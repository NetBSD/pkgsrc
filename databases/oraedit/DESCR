oraedit is capable of editing functions, procedure,
package bodies and specification, type body and specifications
as well as views stored in Oracle. The only thing required is
working sqlplus client or working rsh/ssh connection
to a computer with one (and Python, of course).

oraedit was used as a replacement for Platinum's SQL-Station,
to get rid MS Windows for a development box. It surely
doesn't have every feature SQL-Station has, but hey - the
fact it works under Unix is appealing :) It's particularly
usable in connection with some decent GUI editor, such as vim.

Documentation is currently not present, you have to figure out
usage yourself ATM, sorry.
