SQL::Translator is a group of Perl modules that converts vendor-specific
SQL table definitions into other formats, such as other vendor-specific
SQL, ER diagrams, documentation (POD and HTML), XML, and Class::DBI
classes. The main focus of SQL::Translator is SQL, but parsers
exist for other structured data formats, including Excel spreadsheets
and arbitrarily delimited text files. Through the separation of
the code into parsers and producers with an object model in between,
it's possible to combine any parser with any producer, to plug in
custom parsers or producers, or to manipulate the parsed data via
the built-in object model. Presently only the definition parts of
SQL are handled (CREATE, ALTER), not the manipulation of data
(INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
