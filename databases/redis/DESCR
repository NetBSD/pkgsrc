Redis is an advanced key-value store. It is similar to memcached but the
dataset is not volatile, and values can be strings, exactly like in memcached,
but also lists, sets, and ordered sets. All this data types can be manipulated
with atomic operations to push/pop elements, add/remove elements, perform
server side union, intersection, difference between sets, and so forth. Redis
supports different kind of sorting abilities.
