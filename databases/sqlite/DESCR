SQLite is a C library that implements an SQL database engine. Programs
that link with the SQLite library can have SQL database access without
running a separate RDBMS process. The distribution comes with a standalone
command-line access program (sqlite) that can be used to administer an
SQLite database and which serves as an example of how to use the SQLite
library.

SQLite is not a client library used to connect to a big database server.
SQLite is the server. The SQLite library reads and writes directly to and
from the database files on disk.
