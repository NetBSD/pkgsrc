Mongo (from "humongous") is a high-performance, open source, schema-free,
document-oriented database. It features: document data model with dynamic
schemas; full, flexible index support and rich queries; auto-Sharding for
horizontal scalability; built-in replication for high availability; text
search; advanced security; aggregation Framework and MapReduce; large media
storage with GridFS.

This is an older version of mongodb, chosen to avoid the Server Side
Public License and a need for a c++17 compiler.
