After the tables are set up and the MySQL server is running, a root
password will be automatically generated; details can be found in the
server logs. On creation, it is marked as expired, and must be changed
immediately.

There is a script distributed with MySQL that can help you lock down
an installation.  This script has been installed to

  ${PREFIX}/bin/mysql_secure_installation.

For both these topics, please see the manual and the MySQL web site for
further instructions.
