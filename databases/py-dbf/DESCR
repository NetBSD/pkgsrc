Currently supports dBase III, Clipper, FoxPro, and Visual FoxPro
tables. Text is returned as unicode, and codepage settings in tables
are honored. Memos and Null fields are supported. Documentation
needs work, but author is very responsive to e-mails.

Not supported: index files (but can create tempory non-file indexes),
auto-incrementing fields, and Varchar fields.
