Please see the PL/Python section of the PostgreSQL Programmer's Guide
(databases/postgresql-docs) for information on programming with
${PKGNAME}.

Note that PL/Python is unrestricted language, meaning it does not
offer any way of restricting what users can do in it.  Any DB user with
access to PL/Python can run arbitrary Python code under privileges
of the PostgreSQL server process.

To enable PL/Python for database <dbname>, run following:

createlang plpythonu <dbname>
