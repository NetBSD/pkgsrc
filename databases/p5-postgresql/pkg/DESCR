  Pgsql_perl5 is an interface between Larry Wall's language perl
version 5 and the database PostgreSQL (previously Postgres95).  This
has been done by using the Perl5 application programming interface
for C extensions which calls the Postgres programmer's interface
LIBPQ.  Pgsql_perl5 tries to implement the LIBPQ- interface as close
as possible.

  You have the choice between two different interfaces: the old
C-style like interface and a new one, using a more Perl-ish like
style.  The old style has the benefit, that existing Libpq
applications can easily be ported to perl. The new style uses class
packages and might be more familiar for C++- programmers.

Perl README file.
