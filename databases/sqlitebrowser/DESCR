SQLite Database Browser is a freeware, public domain, open source
visual tool used to create, design and edit database files compatible
with SQLite. It is meant to be used for users and developers that
want to create databases, edit and search data using a familiar
spreadsheet-like interface, without the need to learn complicated
SQL commands.
