  The perl-ldap distribution is a collection of perl modules which provide an
object orientated interface to LDAP servers. 

  The perl-ldap distribution has several advantages:

  * By using the perl object interface the perl-ldap modules provide
    programmers with an interface which allows complex searches of LDAP
    directories with only a small amount of code. 

  * All the perl-ldap modules are written entirely in perl, which means that
    the library is truly cross-platform compatible.  No C or XS extension are
    used so no C compiler is needed to install the modules.
