Gramps (Genealogical Research and Analysis Management Programming System)
is a personal genealogy program. It provides a graphical interface for
recording genealogical research.

Gramps can import GEDCOM format and export to GEDCOM and Web Family Tree.
It can generate book reports, ancestor charts, relationship graphs, timelines,
Ahnentafel reports, websites, and various other comprehensive reports
in various documentation formats.

Gramps can also include extra media types (like JPEG images and audio
files), record sources of information, and keep track of locations
(place names).
