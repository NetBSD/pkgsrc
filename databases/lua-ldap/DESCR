LuaLDAP is a simple interface from Lua to an LDAP client, in fact
it is a bind to OpenLDAP (https://www.openldap.org) client or ADSI
(https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adsi/about-adsi).

It enables a Lua program to:

* Connect to an LDAP server;
* Execute any operation (search, add, compare, delete, modify and rename);
* Retrieve entries and references of the search result.
