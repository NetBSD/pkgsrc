MySQL is a SQL (Structured Query Language) database server. SQL is the most
popular database language in the world. MySQL is a client-server implementation
that consists of a server daemon `mysqld' and many different client
programs/libraries.

The main goals of MySQL are speed and robustness.

The base upon which MySQL is built is a set of routines that have been used in
a highly demanding production environment for many years.  While MySQL is still
in development it already offers a rich and highly useful function set.

The official way to pronounce 'MySQL' is 'My Ess Que Ell' (Not MY-SEQUEL).

This package contains the MySQL client programs and libraries.

This is an old version, scheduled to be EOL in October, 2023.
