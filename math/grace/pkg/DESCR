Grace is a tool to make two-dimensional plots of scientific
data. It runs under various (if not all) flavours of UNIX
with X11 and Motif. Its capabilities are roughly similar to
GUI-based programs like Sigmaplot or Microcal Origin plus
script-based tools like gnuplot or Genplot.  Its strength
lies in the fact that it combines the convenience of a
graphical user interface with the power of a scripting
language which enables it to do sophisticated calculations
or perform automated tasks.
Grace is derived from Xmgr (a.k.a. ACE/gr), originally
written by Paul Turner.
