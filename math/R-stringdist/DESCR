Implements an approximate string matching version of R's native
'match' function. Can calculate various string distances based on
edits (Damerau-Levenshtein, Hamming, Levenshtein, optimal sting
alignment), qgrams (q- gram, cosine, jaccard distance) or heuristic
metrics (Jaro, Jaro-Winkler). An implementation of soundex is provided
as well. Distances can be computed between character vectors while
taking proper care of encoding or between integer vectors representing
generic sequences. This package is built for speed and runs in
parallel by using 'openMP'. An API for C or C++ is exposed as well.
