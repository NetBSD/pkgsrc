This GAP package contains a variety of functions for working with Lie
algebras obtained from associative algebras by using the "bracket"
operation ab-ba. 

In case the associative algebra has been constructed using the
GroupRing function, the package uses fast methods that take advantage
of known special properties of group algebras. Some of the functions
provided are LieCentre, LieDerivedSubalgebra, IsLieAbelian,
IsLieSolvable, IsLieNilpotent and variations on these.

There are also functions for maintaining contact with the original
associative ring and with the underlying group in case the algebra is
a group algebra.
