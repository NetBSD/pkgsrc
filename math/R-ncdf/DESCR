This package provides a high-level R interface to Unidata's netCDF
data files, which are portable across platforms and include metadata
information in addition to the data sets.  Using this package netCDF
files can be opened and data sets read in easily.  It is also easy to
create new netCDF dimensions, variables, and files, or manipulate
existing netCDF files.  This interface provides considerably more
functionality than the old "netCDF" package for R, and is not
compatible with the old "netCDF" package for R.
