A tool to provide an easy, intuitive and consistent access to
information contained in various R models, like model formulas, model
terms, information about random effects, data that was used to fit the
model or data from response variables. 'insight' mainly revolves
around two types of functions: Functions that find (the names of)
information, starting with 'find_', and functions that get the
underlying data, starting with 'get_'.  The package has a consistent
syntax and works with many different model objects, where otherwise
functions to access these information are missing.
