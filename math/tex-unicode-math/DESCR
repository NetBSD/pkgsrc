This package provides a comprehensive implementation of unicode
maths for XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX. Unicode maths requires an
OpenType mathematics font, of which there are now a number
available via CTAN. While backwards compatibility is strived
for, there are some differences between the legacy mathematical
definitions in LaTeX and amsmath, and the Unicode mathematics
definitions. Care should be taken when transitioning from a
legacy workflow to a Unicode-based one.
