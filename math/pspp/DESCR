PSPP is a program for statistical analysis of sampled data.  It interprets
commands in the SPSS language and produces tabular output in ASCII, HTML,
or PostScript format.  In previous releases, PSPP was known as Fiasco.

A main goal of the PSPP project is compatibility with the SPSS language.
PSPP also aims to be written better than the program it replaces.  Right
now this includes: 

  * High-quality output formatting: 
      - Presentation-quality tables on devices that can handle it, such
        as laser printers and raster displays.  This is currently implemented
        through a PostScript driver and a simple HTML tables driver.
      - Other devices, such as terminals and dot-matrix printers, are
        supported through an ASCII driver.  IBM PC box-drawing
        characters can also be used.  Bold and italics are supported
        if the underlying device supports them.
      - Output can be directed to multiple devices at once and
        retain the unique output properties of each device.
      - All this can be done on any operating system that PSPP supports.
        Though the latest versions of what PSPP replaces support similar
        functionality, they do so only under non-free Microsoft
        operating systems. 
  * Portability: PSPP is easy to port. It should be simple to port it
        to any operating system having an ANSI C compiler.
