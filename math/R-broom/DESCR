Summarizes key information about statistical objects in tidy tibbles.
This makes it easy to report results, create plots and consistently
work with large numbers of models at once. Broom provides three verbs
that each provide different types of information about a model. tidy()
summarizes information about model components such as coefficients of
a regression. glance() reports information about an entire model, such
as goodness of fit measures like AIC and BIC. augment() adds
information about individual observations to a dataset, such as fitted
values or influence measures.
