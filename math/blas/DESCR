The BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) are high quality "building
block" routines for performing basic vector and matrix
operations. Level 1 BLAS do vector-vector operations, Level 2 BLAS do
matrix-vector operations, and Level 3 BLAS do matrix-matrix
operations. Because the BLAS are efficient, portable, and widely
available, they're commonly used in the development of high quality
linear algebra software, LINPACK and LAPACK for example.

This package contains the Fortran 77 reference implementation of BLAS.
