Provides tools for determining estimability of linear functions of
regression coefficients, and 'epredict' methods that handle
non-estimable cases correctly. Estimability theory is discussed in
many linear-models textbooks including Chapter 3 of Monahan, JF
(2008), "A Primer on Linear Models", Chapman and Hall (ISBN
978-1-4200-6201-4).
