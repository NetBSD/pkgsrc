Nickle is a desk calculator  language  with  powerful  programming  and
scripting  capabilities.  Nickle supports a variety of datatypes, espe-
cially arbitrary precision integers, rationals,  and  imprecise  reals.
The  input language vaguely resembles C.  Some things in C which do not
translate easily are different, some design choices have been made dif-
ferently, and a very few features are simply missing.
