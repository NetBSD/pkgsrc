This package is a GAP interface to a C program called fplsa for 
dealing with finitely presented Lie super-algebras.

When K is a finitely-presented Lie algebra, the GAP Operation
`IsomorphismSCTableAlgebra' can be used to make the structure of K
explicit, in the form of an isomorphic algebra given by structure
constants, which is much more amenable to further computations.

This GAP package installs an alternative method for this Operation,
which calls fplsa to do the hard part of the computation. This speeds 
up the calculation and permits larger problems to be attempted. The 
external program has much additional functionality which is not used 
by the present version of the package.
