statsmodels is a Python module that provides classes and functions for
the estimation of many different statistical models, as well as for
conducting statistical tests, and statistical data exploration. An
extensive list of result statistics are available for each
estimator. The results are tested against existing statistical
packages to ensure that they are correct.
