PLUMED is an open-source, community-developed library that provides a
wide range of different methods, which include:

    enhanced-sampling algorithms free-energy methods tools to analyze the
    vast amounts of data produced by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.

These techniques can be used in combination with a large toolbox
of collective variables that describe complex processes in physics,
chemistry, material science, and biology.
