The remserial program acts as a communications bridge between a
TCP/IP network port and a Linux device such as a serial port. Any
character-oriented Linux /dev device will work.

The program can also use pseudo-ttys as the device. A pseudo-tty
is like a serial port in that it has a /dev entry that can be opened
by a program that expects a serial port device, except that instead
of belonging to a physical serial device, the data can be intercepted
by another program. The remserial program uses this to connect a
network port to the "master" (programming) side of the pseudo-tty
allowing the device driver (slave) side to be used by some program
expecting a serial port. See example 3 below for details.

The program can operate as a server accepting network connections
from other machines, or as a client, connecting to remote machine
that is running the remserial program or some other program that
accepts a raw network connection. The network connection passes
data as-is, there is no control protocol over the network socket.

Multiple copies of the program can run on the same computer at the
same time assuming each is using a different network port and
device.
