This is an optional collection of sound files, with the same content
and in the same voice as the originals, but in better formats (uLaw
and aLaw) to avoid transcoding when talking to a uLaw/aLaw capable
peer.

(This package is for very old versions of asterisk, and does not
install files in the expected place.)
