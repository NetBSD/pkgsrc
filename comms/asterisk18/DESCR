Asterisk is a complete PBX in software.  It provides all of the
features you would expect from a PBX and more. Asterisk does voice
over IP in three protocols, and can interoperate with almost all
standards-based telephony equipment using relatively inexpensive
hardware.

Asterisk provides Voicemail services with Directory, Call Conferencing,
Interactive Voice Response, Call Queuing. It has support for
three-way calling, caller ID services, ADSI, SIP and H.323 (as both
client and gateway).

This is a long term support version.  It is scheduled to go to
security fixes only on October 20th, 2024, and EOL on October 20th,
2025.  See here for more information about Asterisk versions:
