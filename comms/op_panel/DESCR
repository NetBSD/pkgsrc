The Flash Operator panel is a 'switchboard' application for the Asterisk PBX
system. It displays information about your Asterisk PBX activity in real time
via a standard web browser with Flash plugin. The display and button layout is
configurable; you can have more than 100 buttons on the screen at once.

You can see at a glance:
 * What extensions are busy, ringing or available
 * Who is talking and to whom (clid, context, priority)
 * SIP registration status and reachability
 * Meetme room status (number of users) in the room
 * Queue status (number of users waiting)
 * Parked extensions
 * Call duration Timers
 * Logged in Agents

You can perform these actions:
 * Hang-up a channel (double click the colored dot on the button)
 * Transfer a call leg via drag&drop (drag the phone icon on a button to
   another button)
 * Originate calls via drag&drop
 * Drag an available extension to an ongoing conversation and conference the
   three together.
 * Change the callerid text to something meaningfull when transferring or
   originating a call
 * Mute/Unmute meetme participants
