Asterisk is a complete PBX in software.  It provides all of the
features you would expect from a PBX and more. Asterisk does voice
over IP in three protocols, and can interoperate with almost all
standards-based telephony equipment using relatively inexpensive
hardware.

Asterisk provides Voicemail services with Directory, Call Conferencing,
Interactive Voice Response, Call Queuing. It has support for
three-way calling, caller ID services, ADSI, SIP and H.323 (as both
client and gateway).

NOTE:  This version does not work with the zaptel drivers.  It
requires the newer DAHDI drivers which are still being ported.
So, there is no hardware support available at this moment.
