OpenSync is a synchronization framework that is platform and distribution
independent. It consists of a powerful sync-engine and several plugins
that can be used to connect to devices.

OpenSync is very flexible and capable of synchronizing any type of data,
including contacts, calendar, tasks, notes and files.

This plugin synchronizes with the KDE 3.5 Desktop.
