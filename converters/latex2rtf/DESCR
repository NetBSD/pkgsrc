latex2rtf - Converts LaTeX file to RTF text-format

The latex2rtf command converts a LaTeX file into RTF text format. The
text and much of the formatting information is translated to RTF
making the new file look very similar to the original.

This package also provides latex2png for converting a LaTeX or EPS
files to a PNG image. It needs latex, ImageMagick's convert, dvips
and Ghostscript's eps2eps.
