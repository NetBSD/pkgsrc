Pandoc is a Haskell library for converting from one markup format to
another, and a command-line tool that uses this library. It can read
several dialects of Markdown and (subsets of) HTML, reStructuredText,
LaTeX, DocBook, JATS, MediaWiki markup, DokuWiki markup, TWiki markup,
TikiWiki markup, Jira markup, Creole 1.0, Haddock markup, OPML, Emacs
Org-Mode, Emacs Muse, txt2tags, ipynb (Jupyter notebooks), Vimwiki,
Word Docx, ODT, EPUB, FictionBook2, roff man, and Textile, and it can
write Markdown, reStructuredText, XHTML, HTML 5, LaTeX, ConTeXt,
DocBook, JATS, OPML, TEI, OpenDocument, ODT, Word docx, PowerPoint
pptx, RTF, MediaWiki, DokuWiki, XWiki, ZimWiki, Textile, Jira, roff
man, roff ms, plain text, Emacs Org-Mode, AsciiDoc, Haddock markup,
EPUB (v2 and v3), ipynb, FictionBook2, InDesign ICML, Muse, LaTeX
beamer slides, and several kinds of HTML/JavaScript slide shows (S5,
Slidy, Slideous, DZSlides, reveal.js).

In contrast to most existing tools for converting Markdown to HTML,
pandoc has a modular design: it consists of a set of readers, which
parse text in a given format and produce a native representation of
the document, and a set of writers, which convert this native
representation into a target format. Thus, adding an input or output
format requires only adding a reader or writer.
