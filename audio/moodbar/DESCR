Moodbar is a music visualization method that assigns colors to different
parts of a track and presents them as a timeline. Applied to a music player,
the main goal is to help the user navigate within a particular track. For
example, if the user wants to skip to the first chorus of a song, a good
moodbar implementation should be able to provide a hint of where this might
occur in the timeline.
