mad123 is a simple command line MP3 player using Robert Leslie's
libmad fixed-point MP3 decoder library.

This is not meant to be a serious replacement for the ubiquitous
mpg123 program.  Instead, this is a merely an experiment in using
libmad.  At the time mad123 was written, a couple of things set it
apart from the command line MP3 player supplied with libmad (madplay):

1) Supports URL style MP3 pathnames.

2) The audio output is double-buffered. Multiple audio backends
   such as Sun (OSS), aRts, and pcm are supported.

3) Streams can be pre-buffered using read-ahead.

4) Simple keyboard controls.

5) Playlist support.

6) CTRL-C behaves like it does for mpg123.

7) It can be installed setuid-root so it can adjust scheduling
priority to reduce its susceptiblity to jitter.
