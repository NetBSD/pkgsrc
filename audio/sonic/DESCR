Sonic is a simple algorithm for speeding up or slowing down speech.
However, it's optimized for speed ups of over 2X, unlike previous
algorithms for changing speech rate.  The Sonic library is a very
simple ANSI C library that is designed to easily be integrated into
streaming voice applications, like TTS back ends.
