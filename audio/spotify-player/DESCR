spotify-player is a custom Spotify player built and tweaked based on my personal
preferences. It is fast, easy to use, and configurable.

It's designed to be a player, not a fully-fledged Spotify clone, so it does not
aim to support all possible Spotify features.
The main goal is to provide a quick and intuitive way to modify the current
playback by either using player commands or navigating between different
contexts.
Similar to other TUI applications, is keyboard driven. User will use a set of
predefined commands with shortcuts to interact with the player.
spotify-player has a simple UI with three main components:
-a playback window displaying the current playback
-a context window displaying a context (playlist, album, artist)
-popup windows for using some commands (switch theme, browser playlists, etc)
or displaying additional information

spotify-player is built on top of tui, rspotify, and librespot libraries.
It's inspired by spotify-tui and ncspot.
