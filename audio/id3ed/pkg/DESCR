   id3ed  edits  the  "id3"  tag  for mpeg layer3 files.  The
   mpeg3 specification does not provide any method for  stor-
   ing  song  information,  however  the id3 tag has become a
   standard method for doing this, and most mp3  players  can
   read  the  tag.   It  will not cause any errors in players
   that do not support it.  The tag is 128 bytes long and  is
   located at the end of the file.
