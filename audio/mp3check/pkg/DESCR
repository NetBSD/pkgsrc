Check mp3 files for consistency and print several errors and warnings. List 
stream attributes (color). Layer 1,2,3, mpeg1.0+2.0 are currently supported. 
CRC check for layer 3. 
mp3check is very useful for incomplete mp3 detection as it can be used to scan 
through your mp3 collection and find all mp3s that aren't perfect. Good for use
with Napster and other bulk downloading of mp3s.
