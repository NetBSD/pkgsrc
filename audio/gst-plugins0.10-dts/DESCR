GStreamer is a library that allows the construction of graphs of
media-handling components, ranging from simple Ogg/Vorbis playback to
complex audio (mixing) and video (non-linear editing) processing. 

Applications can take advantage of advances in codec and filter technology
transparently.  Developers can add new codecs and filters by writing a
simple plugin with a clean, generic interface. 

GStreamer is released under the LGPL.

This package is part of the 'bad' plugins for GStreamer.  It provides the
dtsdec plugin, which allows playback of DTS audio streams.
