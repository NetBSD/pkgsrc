MBROLA based American English female voice for the festival speech
synthesis system.

This voice provides a American English female voice using the MBROLA
synthesis method.  It uses a modified CMU lexicon for pronunciations.
Prosodic phrasing is provided by a statistically trained model using
part of speech and local distribution of breaks.  Intonation is
provided by a CART tree predicting ToBI accents and an F0 contour
generated from a model trained from natural speech.  The duration
model is also trained from data using a CART tree.
