  libcdaudio is a multi-platform CD player development library which works with
NetBSD, Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, and Irix. It includes a basic command
set for controlling the operation of the CD-ROM drive as well as functions for
accessing both the CDDB, CD Index, and Cover Art Index.

  It is recommened that all programs wishing to specifically use CDDB data use
the FreeDB at "http://www.freedb.org/", which works well with libcdaudio.

  The CD Index ("http://www.cdindex.org/") is a rethought track information
mangement system that uses SQL servers to manage the data.  This is another
track information method libcdaudio is capable of using.

  The Cover Art Index ("http://coverart.undergrid.net/") provides a method of
locating cover art for a particular CD based upon the disc's name or CD Index
ID.

  The entire libcdaudio API may be found in the libcdaudio programmer's manual
at "http://cdcd.undergrid.net/libcdaudio/manual/".  The interface to the given
functions will remain as they are specified, although new functions may continue
to be added.
