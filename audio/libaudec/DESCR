libaudec (lib audio decoder) is a wrapper library over minimp3, sndfile and
libsamplerate for reading and resampling audio files, based on Robin Gareus'
audio_decoder code.

libaudec supports all formats supported by sndfile, in addition to MP3.

This library is meant to be linked in statically to larger projects.

Until version 1.0 is released, the API is subject to change.

libaudec is released under the GNU Affero GPLv3+.
