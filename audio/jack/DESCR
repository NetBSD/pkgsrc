JACK (JACK Audio Connection Kit) provides a basic infrastructure for audio
applications to communicate with each other and with audio hardware. Through
JACK, users are enabled to build powerful systems for signal processing and
music production.

JACK2 aka jackdmp is a C++ version of the JACK low-latency audio server for
