Please refer to the following file on how to setup your Ampache
installation.

	${INSTDIR}/docs/INSTALL

You will need to make Ampache accessible through your HTTP server.
If you are running Apache and ap-php, then you can add the following
lines to httpd.conf:

	Include ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/ampache.conf

You will also need to ensure php.ini has the following enabled:

	extension=mysql.so
	extension=iconv.so
