TwoLAME is an optimised MPEG Audio Layer 2 (MP2) encoder based on
tooLAME by Mike Cheng, which in turn is based upon the ISO dist10
code and portions of LAME.

Features added to TwoLAME:

    * Fully thread-safe
    * Static and shared library (libtwolame)
    * API very similar to LAME's (for easy porting)
    * Frontend supports wider range of input files (using libsndfile)
    * automake/libtool/pkgconfig based build system
    * C99 compliant
