The Uninterrupted Broadcasting System (UBS) is a program designed to run the 
operations of a radio station when a DJ isn't in house. This includes playing 
station ID's, public service announcements, and songs. This program is 
similar in function (but not design nor implementation) to DRS 2006.

The UBS was not intended to be used for webcasting, but it could presumably 
be adapted for this purpose. The intented audience of the UBS is smaller 
college/high school/commercial radio stations which wish to do unattended 
broadcasting via a stable and reliable computer daemon.
