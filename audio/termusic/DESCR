Terminal Music Player written in Rust.

As a contributor of gomu, https://github.com/issadarkthing/gomu I met serious
problems during development. The main problem is data race condition.
So I basically rewrite the player in rust, and hope to solve the problem.

If you wish to download mp3 from youtube, install youtube-dl.

Upstream recently changed the default audio-backend to GStreamer.
To play audio on BSD install gst-plugins1-oss.
To play audio on Linux install gst-plugins1-alsa or gst-plugins1-pulse.
