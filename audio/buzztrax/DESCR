Buzztrax aims to be a music studio that allows one to compose songs using
only a computer with a soundcard. If you've used tracker programs like
FastTracker, Impulse Tracker, or the original AMIGA SoundTracker, that will
give you an idea of how one can sequence music in Buzztrax. The Buzztrax
editor uses a similar concept, where a song consists of a sequence with
tracks and in each track one uses patterns with events (musical notes and
control changes).

In contrast to other Tracker programs, tracks are not simply sample players:
a user can make a song using an arrangment of virtual audio plugins that
are linked together to create different effects. Each of these machines can
be controlled realtime or via patterns in the sequencer.
