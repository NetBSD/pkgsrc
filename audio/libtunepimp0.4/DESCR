The TunePimp library serves as a tool to allow developers to create
MusicBrainz enabled tagging applications.

The TunePimp library is a full featured tagging library that allows
the developer to open music files for identification/lookup. Once
files have been identified, it writes new metadata tags to the
music files and writes the files to a standardized directory
hierarchy. TunePimp includes the following features:

* Create TRM IDs from WAV, MP3, Ogg/Vorbis and FLAC files
* Automatically lookup files by TRM or by metadata
* Read and write metadata from the music files
* Optionally rename files according to a user specified file mask
* Optionally move files to a user specified directory hierarchy

This package contains the older 0.4 release; the current version
is in audio/libtunepimp.
