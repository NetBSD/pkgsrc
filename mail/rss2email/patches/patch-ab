+.TH R2E 1a
+.SH NAME
+r2e \- receive RSS feeds by email
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+.B r2e action [options]
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+.BR r2e
+is a simple program which you can run in your crontab.
+It watches RSS feeds and sends you nicely formatted email message
+for each new item.
+.P
+The program is configured by ~/.rss2email/config.py
+.P
+For a quick start with r2e, try these steps:
+.P
+.RS
+.nf
+.BI "r2e new " your@address
+.BI "r2e add " http://feed.url/somewhere.rss
+.BI "r2e run "
+.RE
+.P
+The last command should eventually be put into your crontab, if you
+want things be sent you automatically.
+.SH ACTIONS
+.TP
+.B new [youremail]
+Create a new feedfile. If the second option is specified, it sets the
+default email address that mails are sent to.
+.TP
+.B add url [youremail]
+Subscribe to a feed. The first option is the URL of the feed.
+The optional second option is the email address to send new items to.
+Repeat for each feed you want to subscribe to.
+.TP
+.B run [--no-send]
+Scan the feeds and send emails for new items. This can be run in a cron
+job.
+The --no-send option stops r2e from sending any email. This can be
+useful the first time you run it, as otherwise it would send every
+available story.
+.TP
+.B email yournewemail
+Change the default email address.
+.TP
+.B list
+List all your currently subscribed feeds.
+.TP
+.B delete n
+Delete a feed, using its number from the list command.
+.SH "CONFIGURATION"
+The following configuration variables can be set in the ~/.rss2email/config.py
+config file. The file is a python file, so variables are set using a syntax
+like this: VARIABLE = "value"
+.P
+If the value is a number, the quotes may be omitted. Most configuration
+variables in the file are boolean values, where a 1 indicates the option is
+set, and a 0 disables it.
+.TP
+.B DEFAULT_FROM
+The email address messages are from by default, if the rss feed does not
+specify an email address. The default valus is "bozo@dev.null"
+.TP
+.B FORCE_FROM
+If set, the DEFAULT_FROM address will always be used, otherwise use 
+the email address specified by the feed, when possible.
+.TP
+.B HTML_MAIL
+If set, HTML mail will be sent as such. Otherwise, entries will be
+converted to plain text before sending.
+.TP

+each time a post changes.
+.TP
+.B DATE_HEADER
+If set, the mail's date will be set to the date the item was posted, if
+possible. Otherwise, the date will be based on the time the email is sent.
+.TP
