ImapProxy is a caching IMAP proxy daemon designed to be used with
Horde/IMP.  The program forwards all traffic between the client and the
server, but keeps the connection to the server alive after the client logs
out.  When the same user attempts to log in again, the proxy will use the
cached username/password pair to authenticate the client, and tie the new
client to the old server connection (which was kept alive).
