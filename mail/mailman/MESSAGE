Mailman needs to know your mail domain and Web server hostname.  Edit
${PREFIX}/lib/mailman/Mailman/mm_cfg.py and insert your hostname
in place of "localhost" in DEFAULT_EMAIL_HOST and DEFAULT_URL_HOST.

You will need to make mailman accessible through your HTTP server.
If you are running Apache, then you may add the following line to httpd.conf:

	Include ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/mailman.conf

to make mailman and its archive accessible through, respectively,

	http://www.domain.com/mailman/
	http://www.domain.com/pipermail/

You will also need to add some crontab entries for the user ${MAILMAN_USER}.
You can use ${EXECDIR}/cron/crontab.in as template.

See the files in ${DOCDIR} for how to use mailman, especially
the file ${DOCDIR}/mailman-install.txt and, if you are upgrading 
an existing mailman installation, ${DOCDIR}/UPGRADING.
