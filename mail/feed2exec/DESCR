feed2exec is a simple program that runs custom actions on new RSS feed
items (or whatever feedparser can read). It currently has support for
writing into mailboxes (Maildir folders) or executing commands, but more
actions can be easily implemented through plugins. Email are saved as
multipart plain/HTML and can be sent to arbitrary folders.
