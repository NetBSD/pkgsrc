Exim is a mail transport agent (MTA) developed at the University of Cambridge
for use on Unix systems connected to the Internet. It is freely available
under the terms of the GNU General Public Licence. In style it is similar to
Smail 3, but its facilities are more extensive, and in particular it has
options for verifying incoming sender and recipient addresses, for refusing
mail from specified hosts, networks, or senders, and for controlling mail
relaying.
