To use exim, you will need to perform the following steps manually; it is
inappropriate for this package to make the changes for you.

1. Add a `mail' user: mail:*:8:6::0:0:Mail subsystem:/var/mail:/sbin/nologin
2. Set the correct ownership and permissions on the exim log directory:
   chown mail:mail /var/log/exim && chmod 750 /var/log/exim
3. Read the documentation. Edit ${PREFIX}/etc/exim/configure to taste. Note
   that depending on the version of NetBSD, the `aliases' file may be in
   /etc/mail and not /etc, as it was previously.
4. Back-up /etc/mailer.conf to /etc/mailer.conf.sendmail.
   Copy ${PREFIX}/etc/exim/mailer.conf.exim to /etc/mailer.conf.
5. Set sendmail=NO in /etc/rc.conf. Add the folllowing to /etc/rc.local:
   echo -n ' exim'; ${PREFIX}/etc/rc.d/exim
6. Configuring log rotation is dependant on personal taste and the version of
   NetBSD in use. See weekly.conf(5), newsyslog(8), exicyclog and eximstats.
