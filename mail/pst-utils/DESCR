pst-utils contains a set of tools to read and convert Outlook PST
(Personal Folders) files. The main tools are:
 * readpst - convert PST files to mbox and other formats
 * lspst - list PST file data

The package has been renamed from libpst to pst-utils to better
reflect that its main purpose is to provide utilities rather than
libraries for use by other packages.
