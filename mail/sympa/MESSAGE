Run ${SYMPA_BIN}/sympa_wizard.pl
for interactive configuration.

If you are upgrading from a previous version please consult
${PREFIX}/share/doc/sympa/NEWS
for incompatible changes, and run:
${SYMPA_BIN}/sympa.pl --upgrade

If upgrading from sympa 5.4, you need add the necessary scripts and entries
to /etc/rc.d/ and /etc/rc.conf to start the bulk daemon.
Also, note that configuration files sympa.conf and wwsympa.conf have
moved to ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}. Move these files before running
'${SYMPA_BIN}/sympa.pl --upgrade'
You also need to ajust paths in your httpd.conf file:
/wws is now ${PREFIX}/sympa/libexec/cgi-bin/wwsympa-wrapper.fcgi
/static-sympa is now ${SYMPA_VARBASE}/list_data/static_content
Password encoding has changed; run:
${SYMPA_BIN}/sympa.pl --md5_encode_password
to reencode them to the new format.
