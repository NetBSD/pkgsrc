Sympa is a mailing-list manager. As such, its goal is to automate all 
mailing-list operation such as subscription with automatic authentication, 
unsubscription, but also archiving message, sending digests on a regular 
basis, expiration of addresses, and so on.

Sympa is developped by the CRU (French Universities Network Committee) ; 
it is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License 
Version 2.

Sympa is designed to be highly customizable, easy to manage and efficient. 
Sympa is therefore a nice solution for managing small intranet mailing 
lists as well as very large ISP mailing list services.
