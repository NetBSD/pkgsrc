Bogofilter is a mail filter that classifies mail as spam or ham 
(non-spam) by a statistical analysis of the message's header and 
content (body).  The program is able to learn from the user's 
classifications and corrections.

The statistical technique is known as the Bayesian technique and 
its use for spam was first described by Paul Graham in his article 
A Plan For Spam.  Gary Robinson, in his weblog Rants, suggests some 
refinements for improved discrimination between spam and ham. 
Bogofilter's primary algorithm uses the f(w) parameter and the 
Fisher inverse chi-square technique that he describes.

Bogofilter is run by an MDA script to classify an incoming message 
as spam or ham (using wordlists stored by BerkeleyDB).  Bogofilter 
provides processing for plain text and html.  It supports multi-part 
mime message with decoding of base64, quoted-printable, and 
uuencoded text and ignores attachments, such as images.

Bogofilter is written in C.  Supported platforms: Linux, FreeBSD, 
Solaris, OS X, HP-UX, AIX, ...
