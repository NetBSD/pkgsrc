  Mail::IMAPClient module provides perl routines that simplify a
sockets connection to and an IMAP conversation with an IMAP server.

  This module was developed on Solaris 2.5.1 and 2.6 against Netscape
IMAP servers versions 3.6 and 4.1.  However, since it is written inw
erl and designed for flexibility, it should run on any OS with a
TCP/IP stack and a version of perl that includes Socket.pm and
IO::Socket.pm. It also should be able to talk to any IMAP server,
even those that have, um, proprietary features (assuming that the
programmer knows what those features are). 

  To date, the test suite runs successfully with the following IMAP
servers:

-Netscape Messenger v3.6
-Netscape Messenger v4.1
-UW-IMAP (I think it was 4.5)
-Cyrus IMAP4 v1.5.19
-Mirapoint Message Server Appliances (OS versions 1.6.1 and 1.7.1)
