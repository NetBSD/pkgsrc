The Mutt E-Mail Client by Michael Elkins <me@cs.hmc.edu>

``All mail clients suck.  This one just sucks less.'' -me, circa 1995

Mutt is a small but very powerful text-based MIME mail client.
Mutt is highly configurable, and is well suited to the mail power
user with advanced features like key bindings, keyboard macros,
mail threading, color, PGP and S/MIME, POP3, IMAP, various mailbox
formats, regular expression searches and a powerful pattern matching
language for selecting groups of messages.

This package contains the mutt-kz fork with notmuch support and
another improvements.
