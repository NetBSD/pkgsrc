what is it?
-----------
nmh (new MH) is an electronic mail handling system.  It was
originally based on the package MH-6.8.3, and is intended to be
a (mostly) compatible drop-in replacement for MH.

Although development of nmh is ongoing, it appears to be generally
stable and is in current use.  But it is possible that I may break
things as changes are made.
