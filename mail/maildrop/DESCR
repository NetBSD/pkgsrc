Maildrop is a replacement for your local mail delivery agent.  maildrop
reads a mail message from standard input, then delivers the message to your
mailbox.  maildrop knows how to deliver mail to mbox-style mailboxes, and
maildirs.  "maildir" is a mailbox format used by the Qmail MTA.

Maildrop will optionally read instructions from a file, which describes
how to filter incoming mail.  Instructions can be provided having mail
delivered to alternate mailboxes, or forwarded somewhere else.  Unlike
procmail, maildrop uses a structured filtering language.

This package differs from a vanilla Maildrop installation in that the
files are installed at locations that more closely correspond to a
Courier installation.
