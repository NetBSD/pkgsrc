This plugin enables vCalendar message handling like that produced
by Evolution or Outlook.

When loaded, it will create a vCalendar mailbox in the Folder List,
which will be populated by meetings that you have accepted or
created.  Meeting requests that you receive will be presented in
an appropriate form and you will be able to accept or decline them.
To create a meeting right-click on the vCalendar or Meetings folder
and choose "New meeting...".

You will also be able to subscribe to remote webCal feeds, export
your meetings and calendars, publish your free/busy information
and retrieve that information from others.
