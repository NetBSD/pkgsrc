$NetBSD: patch-modules_src_luacurl_lua-curl-0_3_0_diff,v 1.1 2011/10/09 09:09:29 dholland Exp $

Patch the included patch that patches the included lua-curl to fix
unintended references to /usr/include, and to not choke on certain
multiline comments.

Caution: this is a diff of a diff; cvs diff will give you a diff of a
diff of a diff. If you need to update it, don't whiff, or someone will
be miffed in a jiff, and you might even get biffed in a tiff.
