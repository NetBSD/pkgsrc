GMime is a C library which may be used for the creation and parsing
of messages using the Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension (MIME),
as defined by numerous IETF specifications.

GMime features an extremely robust high-performance parser designed
to be able to preserve byte-for-byte information allowing developers
to re-seralize the parsed messages back to a stream exactly as the
parser found them. It also features integrated GnuPG and S/MIME
v3.2 support.

Built on top of GObject (the object system used by the GNOME
desktop), many developers should find its API design and memory
management very familiar.

This package contains v2.4 of the gmime API.
