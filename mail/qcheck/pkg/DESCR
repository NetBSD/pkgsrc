This is a quick utility to check if there are new mails
on any un*x system running qmail with Maildir. It won't work
for someone running mailboxes in mbox format and I can't be
bothered to add that. Do it yourself if you need to support
this old and crappy format.

The responsible for that tool is my friend Stampel who told
me that my system sucked because it didn't display the number
of unread mails when logging in. Oh well, this just took 5
minutes to add.
