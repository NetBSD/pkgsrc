Thunderbird is a free email, news, and chat application with support for
add-ons, derived from the Mozilla Firefox web browser.

This package provides Thunderbird 52. It is now unsupported and is
provided only for platforms where the Rust toolchain required in
newer Thunderbird versions is problematic, as this is the last release
without a dependency on Rust.

The latest version (in mail/thunderbird) should be preferred on supported
platforms.
