a package for making it easy to abstract the "SpamFriend" and
"SpamHater" features in sendmail, as well as those for whitelisting
certain hosts/addresses/etc.. Especially useful for making sure that
addresses you whitelisted as "always accept for" in /etc/mail/access
also get whitelisted in Milter-based applications as well (be they
senders or recipients)
