This module provides a very simple, very clean, very specific interface to
multiple Email mailers. The goal if this software is to be small and simple,
easy to use, and easy to extend.

Mailers
Mailers are simple to use. You can pre-load mailers when using "Email::Send".

use Email::Send qw[SMTP NNTP];

If you don't preload a mailer before you use it in the "send" function, it
will by dynamically loaded. Mailers are named either relative to the
"Email::Send" namespace, or fully qualified. For example, when using the "IO"
mailer, "Email::Send" first tries to load "Email::Send::IO". If that fails, an
attempt is made to load "IO". If that final attempt fails, "Email::Send" will
throw an exception.
