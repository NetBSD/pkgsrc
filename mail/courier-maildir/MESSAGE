If you are planning on using Courier-IMAP or SqWebMail to serve mail on
the system and you will be using shared maildirs, then you should create
a cron job that runs at regular intervals (once ever few hours is fine)
that executes the following script to update the shared folder index:

    ${PREFIX}/share/courier/sharedindexupdate
