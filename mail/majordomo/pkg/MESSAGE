Post-Install Notes for Majordomo
================================

Before you can use Majordomo, you will need to complete a few steps manually:

	- install majordomo.cf in @HOME@/@MAJORDOMO_USER@.
	  Look in @PREFIX@/share/examples/majordomo for an example and be sure
	  to change instances of @HOSTNAME@ as appropriate.

	- create lists in @HOME@/@MAJORDOMO_USER@.
	  Look in @PREFIX@/share/doc/majordomo for information and see the
	  files and directories for an example list (example-l) in
	  @PREFIX@/share/examples/majordomo.  Pay attention to the permissions
	  on the files and directories.

	- add a .forward file in @HOME@/@MAJORDOMO_USER@ (or an appropriate
	  alias) so administrative mail to @MAJORDOMO_USER@ gets redirected
	  properly.

	- install majordomo aliases for sendmail.
	  For example, create /etc/aliases.majordomo following the example in
	  @PREFIX@/share/examples/majordomo and add it to your sendmail
	  configuration.  This can be done by adding a line similar to the
	  following to /etc/sendmail.cf :

	  OA/etc/aliases.majordomo (for 8.6.x Sendmail),

	  O AliasFile=/etc/aliases,/etc/aliases.majordomo (for 8.7.x and up),

	  or a line similar to the following to your m4 macros file:

	  define(`ALIAS_FILE',/etc/aliases,/etc/aliases.majordomo')

	- if the group for @MAJORDOMO_USER@ (@MAJORDOMO_GROUP@) is not daemon,
	  add @MAJORDOMO_USER@ as a trusted user for sendmail.  This can be
	  done by adding a line similar to the following in /etc/sendmail.cf :

	  T@MAJORDOMO_USER@

	  or a line similar to the following to your m4 macros file:

	  define(`confTRUSTED_USERS', @MAJORDOMO_USER@)dnl

	- be sure to run `newaliases' to create the sendmail database, and
	  be sure that sendmail knows about any changes to /etc/sendmail.cf
	  (e.g., reboot or rerun sendmail)

	- add entries in /etc/newsyslog.conf to rotate the log in
	  @HOME@/@MAJORDOMO_USER@/Log if necessary

Enjoy Majordomo!
