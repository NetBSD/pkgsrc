# Tests for the shell that is available as ${SH} in Makefiles.
#
# On platforms where /bin/sh is not good enough, pkgsrc may use
# different shells, depending on the exact situation.
#
# TOOLS_PLATFORM.sh (which ends up in SH as well) is used for running
# shell programs from mk/ and other programs that typically start with
# a #! line.
#
# The shell commands that are written in the targets of Makefiles (such
# as do-build, pre-configure) are run with a possibly different shell,
# see devel/bmake/Makefile.  This shell is tested by regress/make-shell,
# which also uses this code.
