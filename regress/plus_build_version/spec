# This test demonstrates how the RCS Ids from the package files end up in
# the +BUILD_VERSION file of the binary package.
#
# There are several places in pkgsrc that make use of these RCS Ids:
#
# mk/checksum/checksum, search for "NetBSD":
#	When computing the SHA1 hash for a patch file (before it is applied
#	to the extracted distfile), the RCS Id lines are ignored.
#
# mk/checksum/distinfo.awk, function patchsum:
#	When generating the patches part of the distinfo file.
#	Same as in mk/checksum/checksum.
#
# mk/pkgformat/pkg/metadata.mk, search for "NetBSD":
#	The RCS Ids end up in the +BUILD_VERSION of the binary package.
#
# pkgtools/pbulk/files/pbulk/scripts/pkg-up-to-date, search for "NetBSD":
#	RCS Ids from the source package are extracted and then compared
#	to the RCS Ids from the binary package, to see whether the package
#	needs to be built again.
#
# pkgtools/pkglint/files/distinfo.go, function computePatchSha1Hex:
#	Same as mk/checksum/checksum.
#
# All these places must use the same patterns for extracting the RCS Ids.
# As of January 2020, they don't.
