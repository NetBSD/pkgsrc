Recursive Mono & Sans is a variable type family built for better code
& UI. It is inspired by casual script signpainting, but designed
primarily to meet the needs of programming environments and
application interfaces.

In programming, "recursion" is when a function calls itself, using its
own output as an input to yield powerful results. Recursive Mono was
used as a tool to help build itself: it was used to write Python
scripts to automate type production work and to generate specimen
images, and it was used in HTML, CSS, and JS to create web-based
proofs & prototypes. Through this active usage, Recursive Mono was
crafted to be both fun to look at as well as deeply useful for all-day
work.

Recursive Sans borrows glyphs from its parent mono but adjusts the
widths of many key glyphs for comfortable readability. Its metrics are
superplexed - every style takes up the exact same horizontal space,
across all styles. In this 3-axis variable font, this allows for fluid
transitions between weight, slant, and "expression" (casual to strict
letterforms), all without text shifts or layout reflow. Not only does
this allow for new interactive possibilities in UI, but it also makes
for a uniquely fun typesetting experience.
