The esint package permits access to alternate integral symbols when
you're using the Computer Modern fonts. In the original set, several
integral symbols are missing, such as \oiint. Many of these symbols are
available in other font sets (pxfonts, txfonts, etc.), but there is no
good solution if you want to use Computer Modern. The package provides
Metafont source and LaTeX macro support.
