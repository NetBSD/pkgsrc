Fourier-GUTenberg is a LaTeX typesetting system which uses
Adobe Utopia as its standard base font. Fourier-GUTenberg
provides all complementary typefaces needed to allow Utopia
based TeX typesetting, including an extensive mathematics set
and several other symbols. The system is absolutely
stand-alone: apart from Utopia and Fourier, no other typefaces
are required. The fourier fonts will also work with Adobe
Utopia Expert fonts, which are only available for purchase.
