Fourier-GUTenberg is a LaTeX typesetting system which uses Adobe Utopia
as its standard base font. Fourier-GUTenberg provides all complementary
typefaces needed to allow Utopia based TeX typesetting, including an
extensive mathematics set and several other symbols. The system is
absolutely stand- alone: apart from Utopia and Fourier, no other
typefaces are required. The fourier fonts will also work with Adobe
Utopia Expert fonts, which are only available for purchase. Utopia is a
