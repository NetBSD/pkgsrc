Garamond Libre is a free and open-source old-style font family.
It is a "true Garamond," i.e., it is based off the designs of
16th-century French engraver Claude Garamond (also spelled
Garamont). The Roman design is Garamond's; the italics are from
a design by Robert Granjon. The upright Greek font is after a
design by Firmin Didot; the "italic" Greek font is after a
design by Alexander Wilson. The font family includes support
for Latin, Greek (monotonic and polytonic) and Cyrillic
scripts, as well as small capitals, old-style figures, superior
and inferior figures, historical ligatures, Byzantine musical
symbols, the IPA and swash capitals.
