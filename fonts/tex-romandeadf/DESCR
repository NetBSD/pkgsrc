Romande ADF is a serif font family with oldstyle figures,
designed as a substitute for Times, Tiffany or Caslon. The
family currently includes upright, italic and small-caps shapes
in each of regular and demi-bold weights and an italic script
in regular. The support package renames the fonts according to
the Karl Berry fontname scheme and defines four families. Two
of these primarily provide access to the "standard" or default
characters while the "alternate" families support alternate
characters, additional ligatures and the long s. The included
package files provide access to these features in LaTeX as
explained in the documentation. The LaTeX support requires the
nfssext-cfr and the xkeyval packages.
