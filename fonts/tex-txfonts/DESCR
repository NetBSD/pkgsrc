Txfonts supplies virtual text roman fonts using Adobe Times (or URW
NimbusRomNo9L) with some modified and additional text symbols in the
OT1, T1, and TS1 encodings; maths alphabets using Times/URW Nimbus;
maths fonts providing all the symbols of the Computer Modern and AMS
fonts, including all the Greek capital letters from CMR; and
additional maths fonts of various other symbols.  The set is
complemented by a sans-serif set of text fonts, based on
Helvetica/NimbusSanL, and a monospace set.  All the fonts are in Type
1 format (AFM and PFB files), and are supported by TeX metrics (VF and
TFM files) and macros for use with LaTeX.
