This package provides a Japanese Font Metric supporting
vertical and horizontal typesetting, 'linegap punctuations',
'extended fonts', and more interesting and helpful features
using traditional ('tc') and simplified ('sc') Chinese or
Japanese fonts under LuaTeX-ja. It also makes full use of the
'priority' feature, meeting the standards, and allows easy
customisation.
