Sample configs tailored for NetBSD may have been copied to
${PREFIX}/share/t1lib, but no existing files were overwritten.
More samples may be found in ${PREFIX}/share/examples/t1lib.

Most programs that use the lib will look first in the directory
specified by the environment variable T1LIB_CONFIG_DIR, and then
${PREFIX}/share/t1lib. However, you *must* set T1LIB_CONFIG_DIR
to run the "xglyph" test X client. E.g, for Bourne shells:
 ``T1LIB_CONFIG_DIR=${PREFIX}/share/t1lib xglyph &''

The complete documentation requires LaTeX to build. If you have
the print/teTeX package (or some other "tex"),
``cd ${PREFIX}/share/doc/t1lib; make'' to build t1lib_doc.dvi.
