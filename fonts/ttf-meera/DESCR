Meera is a TrueType font for the Malayalam language.
This is a comprehensive Malayalam font with 1000+ glyphs for all
common Malayalam ligatures.

It has carefully designed ascent, descent metrics optimized for
Malayalam script's vertically stacked conjuncts.  Meera is an even
stroke typeface for better screen rendering, with individually
designed glyphs for complex conjuncts rather than using component
glyphs.

Meera is a san-serif counter part of Rachana font with all traditional
characters.  It is also meant for body text like Rachana, preferably
for a pamphlet or single page designs.  Usage of Meera can be thought
of similar to Helvetica typeface and its variations like Arial.  Meera
Roman glyphs are visually similar to Arial but its orthography
strictly follows Meera Malayalam glyphs. Basic curves and straight
lines are taken from Malayalam ‘റ’ and ‘വ’ characters. This is why
Meera Roman glyphs differ from Helvetica but holds san-serif
characteristics and smoothly sit with its Malayalam glyphs.

Released in 2007, Meera is the default Malayalam font for many
GNU/Linux distros for Malayalam script.  The font is widely used in
web as the primary choice for Malayalam screen font.  The font is
available only in regular style.
