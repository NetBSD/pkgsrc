Baskervald ADF is a serif family with lining figures designed
as a substitute for Baskerville. The family currently includes
upright and italic or oblique shapes in each of regular, bold
and heavy weights. All fonts include the slashed zero and
additional non-standard ligatures. The support package renames
them according to the Karl Berry fontname scheme and defines
two families. One of these primarily provides access to the
"standard" or default characters while the other supports
additional ligatures. The included package files provide access
to these features in LaTeX.
