The package provides the Overlock and OverlockSC families of
fonts, designed by Dario Manuel Muhafara of the TIPO foundry
(http://www.tipo.net.ar), "rounded" sans-serif fonts in three
weights (Regular, Bold, Black) with italic variants for each of
them. There are also small-caps and old-style figures in the
Regular weight.
