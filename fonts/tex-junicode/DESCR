Junicode is a TrueType/OpenType font family with many features
for antiquarians (especially medievalists) based on typefaces
used by the Oxford Press in the late 17th and early 18th
centuries. It works well with Lua(La)TeX or Xe(La)TeX, but the
basic textual features are also available with (pdf)LaTeX.
