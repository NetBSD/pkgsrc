The Pazo Math fonts are a family of PostScript fonts suitable
for typesetting mathematics in combination with the Palatino
family of text fonts. The Pazo Math family is made up of five
fonts provided in Adobe Type 1 format (PazoMath,
PazoMath-Italic, PazoMath-Bold, PazoMath-BoldItalic, and
PazoMathBlackboardBold). These contain, in designs that match
Palatino, glyphs that are usually not available in Palatino and
for which Computer Modern looks odd when combined with
Palatino. These glyphs include the uppercase Greek alphabet in
upright and slanted shapes in regular and bold weights, the
lowercase Greek alphabet in slanted shape in regular and bold
weights, several mathematical glyphs (partialdiff, summation,
product, coproduct, emptyset, infinity, and proportional) in
regular and bold weights, other glyphs (Euro and dotlessj) in
upright and slanted shapes in regular and bold weights, and the
uppercase letters commonly used to represent various number
sets (C, I, N, Q, R, and Z) in blackboard bold. LaTeX macro
support (using package mathpazo.sty) is provided in psnfss (a
required part of any LaTeX distribution).
