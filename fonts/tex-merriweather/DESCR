This package provides the Merriweather and MerriweatherSans
families of fonts, designed by Eben Sorkin, with support for
LaTeX, pdfLaTeX, XeLaTeX, and LuaLaTeX. Merriweather features a
very large x height, slightly condensed letterforms, a mild
diagonal stress, sturdy serifs and open forms. The Sans family
closely harmonizes with the weights and styles of the serif
family. There are four weights and italics for each.
