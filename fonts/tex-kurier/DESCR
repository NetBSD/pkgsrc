Kurier is a two-element sans-serif typeface. It was designed
for a diploma in typeface design at the Warsaw Academy of Fine
Arts under the supervision of Roman Tomaszewski. This
distribution contains a significantly extended set of
characters covering the following modern alphabets: latin
(including Vietnamese), Cyrillic and Greek as well as a number
of additional symbols (including mathematical symbols). The
fonts are prepared in Type 1 and OpenType formats. For use with
TeX the following encoding files have been prepared: T1 (ec),
T2 (abc), and OT2--Cyrillic, T5 (Vietnamese), OT4, QX, texansi
and--nonstandard (IL2 for the Czech fonts), as well as
supporting macros and files defining fonts for LaTeX.
