This package provides LaTeX, pdfLaTeX, XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX
support for the Lobster Two family of fonts, designed by Pablo
Impallari. This is a family of script fonts with many ligatures
and terminal forms; for the best results, use XeLaTeX or
LuaLaTeX. There are two weights and italic variants for both.
