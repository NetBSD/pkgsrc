Knuth's final iteration of his re-interpretation of a c.19
Modern-style font from Monotype.  The family is comprehensive,
offering both sans and roman styles, and a monospaced font, together
with mathematics fonts closely integrated with the mathematical
facilities of TeX itself.  The base fonts are distributed as MetaFont
source, but autotraced PostScript Type 1 versions are available (see
the Bluesky/Y&Y and BaKoMa versions).  The Computer Modern fonts have
inspired many later families, notably the European Computer Modern and
the Latin Modern families.
