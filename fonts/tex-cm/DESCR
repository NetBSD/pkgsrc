Knuth's final iteration of his re-interpretation of a c.19
Modern-style font from Monotype.  The family is comprehensive,
offering both sans and roman styles, and a monospaced font, together
with mathematics fonts closely integrated with the mathematical
facilities of TeX itself.  The base fonts are distributed as Metafont
source, but autotraced PostScript Type 1 versions are available (one
version in the AMS fonts distribution, and also the BaKoMa
distribution).  The Computer Modern fonts have inspired many later
families, notably the European Computer Modern and the Latin Modern
families.
