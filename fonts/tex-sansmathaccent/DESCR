Sans serif maths (produced by the beamer class or the sfmath
package) often has accents positioned incorrectly. This package
fixes the positioning of such accents when the default font
(cmssi) is used for sans serif maths. It will have no effect if
used in a document that does not use the beamer class or the
sfmath package.
