Unscii is a set of bitmapped Unicode fonts based on classic system
fonts. Unscii attempts to support character cell art well while also
being suitable for terminal and programming use.

The two main variants are unscii-8 (8x8) and unscii-16 (8x16). There
are also several alternative styles for unscii-8, as well as a 8x16
"full" variant that incorporates missing Unicode glyphs from Fixedsys
Excelsior and GNU Unifont. "unscii-16-full" falls under GPL because of
how Unifont is licensed; the other variants are in the Public Domain.

HEX and PCF are the only actual bitmapped formats here. HEX is the
same simple hexdump format as used by the Unifont project.

TTF, OTF and WOFF are vectorized because the bitmapped TTF fonts
generated by FontForge didn't seem to work anywhere. Fixes to this
problem are appreciated.
