You will need to add the following lines to /etc/services:

sge_qmaster     6444/tcp
sge_execd       6445/tcp

In addition after installation, you need to set up SGE.  To configure the
master node of the cluster, run:

        cd ${SGE_ROOT} && ./install_qmaster -csp

For the back-end compute nodes, run:

        cd ${SGE_ROOT} && ./install_execd

Additionally, you will want to add the following lines in /etc/csh.cshrc:

# Sun Grid Engine Setup
if ( -f ${SGE_ROOT}/default/common/settings.csh  ) then
        source ${SGE_ROOT}/default/common/settings.csh
endif

and the following in /etc/profile:

if [ -f ${SGE_ROOT}/default/common/settings.sh ]; then
        . ${SGE_ROOT}/default/common/settings.sh
fi
