The Open MPI Project is an open source Message Passing Interface
implementation that is developed and maintained by a consortium of
academic, research, and industry partners.  Open MPI is therefore able
to combine the expertise, technologies, and resources from all across
the High Performance Computing community in order to build the best
MPI library available. Open MPI offers advantages for system and
software vendors, application developers and computer science
researchers.

Features implemented or in short-term development for Open MPI include:
  - Full MPI-3.1 standards conformance
  - Thread safety and concurrency
  - Dynamic process spawning
  - Network and process fault tolerance
  - Support network heterogeneity
  - Single library supports all networks
  - Run-time instrumentation
  - Many job schedulers supported
  - Many OS's supported (32 and 64 bit)
  - Production quality software
  - High performance on all platforms
  - Portable and maintainable
  - Tunable by installers and end-users
  - Component-based design, documented APIs
  - Active, responsive mailing list
  - Open source license based on the BSD license

[Note that the pkgsrc version is very old, but still appears to
support MPI 3.0.]
