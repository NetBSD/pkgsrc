This bundle contains the two packages svg and svg-extract. The
svg package is intended for the automated integration of SVG
graphics into LaTeX documents. Therefore the capabilities
provided by Inkscape -- or more precisely its command line tool
-- are used to export the text within an SVG graphic to a
separate file, which is then rendered by LaTeX. For this
purpose the two commands \includesvg and \includeinkscape are
provided which are very similar to the \includegraphics command
of the graphicx package. In addition, the package svg-extract
allows the extraction of these graphics into independent files
in different graphic formats, exactly as it is rendered within
the LaTeX document, using either ImageMagick or Ghostscript.
