cqcam is a free Color QuickCam (PC/Parallel) control program for
various PC Unixes, written by Patrick Reynolds. It is independent
of Scott Laird's qcam package and those derived from it and has
several features that they do not. cqcam has been tested on Linux,
QNX, FreeBSD, BSDI, and LynxOS, and could probably be ported easily
to (almost) any other PC Unix out there. 

cqcam supports the Color Quickcam and Color Quickcam 2. It does not
support b&w Quickcams. It will support parallel VC Quickcams when
Connectix gets around to posting low-level programming specifications.
USB VC Quickcams may be supported in the more distant future.
