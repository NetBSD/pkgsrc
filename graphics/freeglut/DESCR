freeglut is a completely OpenSourced alternative to the OpenGL 
Utility Toolkit (GLUT) library. GLUT was originally written by 
Mark Kilgard to support the sample programs in the second edition 
OpenGL 'RedBook'. Since then, GLUT has been used in a wide variety 
of practical applications because it is simple, universally available 
and highly portable.
