Bindings to 'ImageMagick': the most comprehensive open-source image
processing library available. Supports many common formats (png, jpeg,
tiff, pdf, etc) and manipulations (rotate, scale, crop, trim, flip,
blur, etc). All operations are vectorized via the Magick++ STL meaning
they operate either on a single frame or a series of frames for
working with layers, collages, or animation. In RStudio images are
automatically previewed when printed to the console, resulting in an
interactive editing environment. The latest version of the package
includes a native graphics device for creating in-memory graphics or
drawing onto images using pixel coordinates.
