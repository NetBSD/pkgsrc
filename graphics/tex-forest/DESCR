The package provides a PGF/TikZ-based mechanism for drawing
linguistic (and other kinds of) trees. Its main features are: a
packing algorithm which can produce very compact trees; a
user-friendly interface consisting of the familiar bracket
encoding of trees plus the key-value interface to
option-setting; many tree-formatting options, with control over
option values of individual nodes and mechanisms for their
manipulation; the possibility to decorate the tree using the
full power of PGF/TikZ; and an externalization mechanism
sensitive to code-changes.
