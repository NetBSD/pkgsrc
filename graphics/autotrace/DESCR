  AutoTrace is a program for converting bitmap to vector graphics.  The aim
of the AutoTrace project is the development of a freely available application
similar to CorelTrace or Adobe Streamline. The author hopes that it will be
better than all commercial available programs. In some aspects it is already
better. Originally it was created as a plugin for GIMP.  Now it is a
standalone program and can be compiled on a UNIX platform using GCC.
