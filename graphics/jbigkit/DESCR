JBIG-KIT implements a highly effective data compression algorithm for
bi-level high-resolution images such as fax pages or scanned
documents.

JBIG-KIT provides a portable library of compression and decompression
functions with a documented interface. You can very easily include
into your image or document processing software. In addition, JBIG-KIT
provides ready-to-use compression and decompression programs with a
simple command line interface (similar to the converters found in Jef
Poskanzer's PBM graphics file conversion package).
