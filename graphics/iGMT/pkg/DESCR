iGMT stands for "Interactive GMT" or "Interactive Mapping of
Geoscientific Datasets". It integrates the processing of various Earth
science datasets with a Tcl/Tk graphical user interface for the
generic mapping tools (GMT).

iGMT software is intended to assist in the creation of GMT scripts and
has built-in data processing capabilities for raster data sets such as
topography, sea-floor age, free air-gravity, the geoid, and various
polygon data files such as earthquake hypocentre lists or hot-spot
locations. Clicking on "Map it!" when running iGMT produces a GMT
script whose postscript output is converted and displayed as a GIF
image.

iGMT is used world-wide at more than 120 institutions for everyday
map-making and teaching GMT.

iGMT itself is distributed under the GNU public license. In addition,
iGMT is not to be used for any military purposes or for any other
activities that are against the spirit as expressed in the Student
Pugwash Pledge (www.spusa.org/pugwash/pledge.html).
