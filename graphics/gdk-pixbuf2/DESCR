GdkPixbuf is a library that loads image data in various formats and stores
it as linear buffers in memory. The buffers can then be scaled, composited,
modified, saved, or rendered.

GdkPixbuf can load image data encoded in different formats, such as PNG,
JPEG, TIFF, TGA and GIF.

Additionally, you can write a GdkPixbuf loader module and install it into
a well-known location, in order to load a file format.

GdkPixbuf is used by the GTK toolkit for loading graphical assets.

GdkPixbuf was split off from GTK+ starting with version 2.22/3.0.
