ZBar is an open source software suite for reading bar codes from various
sources, such as video streams, image files and raw intensity sensors. It
supports many popular symbologies (types of bar codes) including
EAN-13/UPC-A, UPC-E, EAN-8, Code 128, Code 39, Interleaved 2 of 5 and QR
Code.

The flexible, layered implementation facilitates bar code scanning and
decoding for any application: use it stand-alone with the included GUI and
command line programs, easily integrate a bar code scanning widget into
your Qt, GTK+ or PyGTK GUI application, leverage one of the script or
programming interfaces (Python, Perl, C++) ...all the way down to a
streamlined C library suitable for embedded use.
