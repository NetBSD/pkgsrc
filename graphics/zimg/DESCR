The "z" library implements the commonly required image processing
basics of scaling, colorspace conversion, and depth conversion.

A simple API enables conversion between any supported formats to
operate with minimal knowledge from the programmer. All library
routines were designed from the ground-up with correctness,
flexibility, and thread-safety as first priorities. Allocation,
buffering, and I/O are cleanly separated from processing, allowing
the programmer to adapt "z" to many scenarios.
