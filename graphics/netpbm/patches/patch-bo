+README for pnmsmooth.c 2.0
+
+This is a replacement for the pnmsmooth script that is distributed with
+pbmplus/netpbm.  This version of pnmsmooth is written as a C program rather
+than a shell script.  It accepts command line arguments to specify a size 
+other than 3x3 for the convolution matrix and an argument for dumping the 
+resultant convolution matrix as a PGM file.  By default it uses the same 3x3
+matrix size as the pnmsmooth script and can be used as a direct replacement.
+
+Also included are an updated man page and a patch file to update the Imakefile
+in the pnm directory.  You may want to apply the patches by hand if you have
+already modified the Imakefile to add other new programs.   You will then
+have to remake the Makefiles and then type 'make all' in the pnm directory.
