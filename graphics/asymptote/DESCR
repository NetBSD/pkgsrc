Asymptote is a powerful descriptive vector graphics language that
provides a natural coordinate-based framework for technical drawing.
Labels and equations are typeset with LaTeX, for high-quality
PostScript output.

A major advantage of Asymptote over other graphics packages is that
it is a programming language, as opposed to just a graphics program.

Features of Asymptote:

# provides a portable standard for typesetting mathematical figures,
just as TeX/LaTeX has become the standard for typesetting equations;

# generates and embeds 3D vector PRC graphics into PDF files;

# inspired by MetaPost, with a much cleaner, powerful C++-like
programming syntax and floating-point numerics;

# runs on all major platforms (UNIX, MacOS, Microsoft Windows);

# mathematically oriented (e.g. rotation of vectors by complex
multiplication);

# LaTeX typesetting of labels (for document consistency);

# uses simplex method and deferred drawing to solve overall size
constraint issues between fixed-sized objects (labels and arrowheads)
and objects that should scale with figure size;

# fully generalizes MetaPost path construction algorithms to three
dimensions;

# compiles commands into virtual machine code for speed without
sacrificing portability;

# high-level graphics commands are implemented in the Asymptote
language itself, allowing them to be easily tailored to specific
applications.
