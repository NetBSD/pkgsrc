A no-nonsense hardware-accelerated image viewer.

It began as a toy project to make a simple image viewer. The vision is to
create something with a broad support of industry-standard files and gradually
add more image analysis and editing tools.
Here are some reasons why this might be helpful to you:
- Completely bloat-free
- Supports a wide range of images and SVG
- Can display unassociated channels correctly (For example if your image uses
  alpha and color channels to encode data in a special way)
- Lets you pick pixels, displays location and color values
- Offers basic nondestructive editing: Crop, resize, paint, contrast, HSV,
  rotate, blur, noise, ...
