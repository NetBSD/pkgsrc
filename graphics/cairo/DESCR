Cairo is a 2D graphics library with support for multiple output
devices.  Currently supported output targets include the X Window
System, Quartz, Win32, image buffers, PostScript, PDF, and SVG file
output.

Cairo is designed to produce consistent output on all output media
while taking advantage of display hardware acceleration when
available (eg. through the X Render Extension).

The cairo API provides operations similar to the drawing operators
of PostScript and PDF. Operations in cairo including stroking and
filling cubic Bezier splines, transforming and compositing
translucent images, and antialiased text rendering. All drawing
operations can be transformed by any affine transformation (scale,
rotation, shear, etc.)

Cairo is implemented as a library written in the C programming
language, but bindings are available for several different programming
languages.
