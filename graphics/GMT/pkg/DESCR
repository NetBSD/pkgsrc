GMT is a free collection of ~60 UNIX tools that allow users to
manipulate (x,y) and (x,y,z) data sets (including filtering, trend
fitting, gridding, projecting, etc.) and produce Encapsulated
PostScript File (EPS) illustrations ranging from simple x-y plots
through contour maps to artificially illuminated surfaces and 3-D
perspective views in black and white, gray tone, hachure patterns, and
24-bit color. GMT supports 25 common map projections plus linear, log,
and power scaling, and comes with support data such as coastlines,
rivers, and political boundaries.
