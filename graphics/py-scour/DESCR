Scour is an SVG optimizer/cleaner written in Python that reduces the
size of scalable vector graphics by optimizing structure and removing
unnecessary data. It can be used to create streamlined vector graphics
suitable for web deployment, publishing/sharing, or further processing.

The goal of Scour is to output a file that renders identically at a
fraction of the size by removing a lot of redundant information created
by most SVG editors. Optimization options are typically lossless but
can be tweaked for more aggressive cleaning.
