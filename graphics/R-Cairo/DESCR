Cairo graphics device that can be use to create high-quality vector
(PDF, PostScript and SVG) and bitmap output (PNG,JPEG,TIFF), and
high-quality rendering in displays (X11 and Win32). Since it uses the
same back-end for all output, copying across formats is WYSIWYG. Files
are created without the dependence on X11 or other external programs.
This device supports alpha channel (semi-transparent drawing) and
resulting images can contain transparent and semi-transparent regions.
It is ideal for use in server environments (file output) and as a
replacement for other devices that don't have Cairo's capabilities
such as alpha support or anti-aliasing. Backends are modular such that
any subset of backends is supported.
