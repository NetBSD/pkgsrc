Highway is a C++ library for SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data), i.e.
applying the same operation to 'lanes'.

## Why Highway?

- more portable (same source code) than platform-specific intrinsics,
- works on a wider range of compilers than compiler-specific vector extensions,
- more dependable than autovectorization,
- easier to write/maintain than assembly language,
- supports runtime dispatch,
- supports variable-length vector architectures.

## Current status

Supported targets: scalar, SSE4, AVX2, AVX-512, NEON (ARMv7 and v8), WASM SIMD.
Ports to RVV and SVE/SVE2 are in progress.
