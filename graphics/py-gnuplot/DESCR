Gnuplot.py is a Python package that interfaces to gnuplot, the popular
open-source plotting program. It allows you to use gnuplot from within Python
to plot arrays of data from memory, data files, or mathematical functions. If
you use Python to perform computations or as `glue' for numerical programs, you
can use this package to plot data on the fly as they are computed. And the
combination with Python makes it is easy to automate things, including to
create crude `animations' by plotting different datasets one after another.
