  GdkPixbuf is a new GNOME library designed to solve part of Imlib's
design limitations that make it hard to write efficient and highly
modular applications.  The GdkPixbuf library provides a basic,
reference counted structure called GdkPixbuf.  This structure points
to a block of image data, has fields that describe the format of the
image data, and also contains a reference count.  The library also
provides a simple mechanism for loading images from files, and a more
sophisticated mechanism for loading images progressively from
arbitrary buffers.  It also provides utility functions to transform
pixbufs and render them to GDK drawables.

The GdkPixBuf library provides a number of features:
	* Image loading facilities.
	* Rendering of a GdkPixBuf into various formats:
	  drawables (windows, pixmaps), GdkRGB buffers.
