MayaVi is a free, easy to use scientific data visualizer. It is written in
Python and uses the amazing Visualization Toolkit (VTK) for the graphics. It
provides a GUI written using Tkinter. MayaVi is free and distributed under
the conditions of the BSD license. It is also cross platform and should run
on any platform where both Python and VTK are available (which is almost any
*nix, Mac OSX or Windows).
