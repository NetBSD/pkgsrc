Epstopdf is a Perl script that converts an EPS file to an 'encapsulated'
PDF file (a single page file whose media box is the same as the original
EPS's bounding box). The resulting file suitable for inclusion by PDFTeX
as an image. The script is adapted to run both on Windows and on
Unix-alike systems. The script makes use of Ghostscript for the actual
conversion to PDF. It assumes Ghostscript version 6.51 or later, and (by
default) suppresses its automatic rotation of pages where most of the
text is not horizontal. LaTeX users may make use of the epstopdf
package, which will run the epstopdf script "on the fly", thus giving
the illusion that PDFLaTeX is accepting EPS graphic files.
