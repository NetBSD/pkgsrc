  This is the canvas widget library for GNOME2.  Libgnomecanvas was
originally part of the gnome-libs package, but has been split out into
a separate package for GNOME2.

  The GNOME canvas is an engine for structured graphics that offers a rich
imaging model, high performance rendering, and a powerful, high-level API.
It offers a choice of two rendering back-ends, one based on Xlib for
extremely fast display, and another based on Libart, a sophisticated,
antialiased, alpha-compositing engine.  Applications have a choice between
the Xlib imaging model or a superset of the PostScript imaging model,
depending on the level of graphic sophistication required.
