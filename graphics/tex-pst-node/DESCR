The package enables the user to connect information, and to place
labels, without knowing (in advance) the actual positions of the items
to be connected, or where the connecting line should go. The macros are
useful for making graphs and trees, mathematical diagrams, linguistic
syntax diagrams, and so on. The package contents were previously
distributed as a part of the pstricks base distribution.
