The package provides a set of macros for naturally typesetting
electrical and (somewhat less naturally, perhaps) electronic
networks. It is designed as a tool that is easy to use, with a
lean syntax, native to LaTeX, and directly supporting PDF
output format. It has therefore been based on the very
impressive PGF/TikZ package.
