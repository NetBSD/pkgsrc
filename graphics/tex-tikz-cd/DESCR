The general-purpose drawing package TiKZ can be used to typeset
commutative diagrams and other kinds of mathematical pictures,
generating high-quality results.  The present package facilitates
the creation of such diagrams by providing a convenient set of
macros and reasonable default settings.  It also includes an arrow
tip library closely matching the Computer Modern arrow tips, as
well as a general mechanism to use the arrow tips from any math
font in TikZ graphics.
