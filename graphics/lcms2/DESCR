LittleCMS is a CMM, a color management engine; it implements fast
transforms between ICC profiles. "Little" stands for its small
overhead. With a typical footprint of about 100K including C runtime,
you can color-enable your application without the pain of ActiveX,
OCX, redistributables or binaries of any kind. We are using little cms
in several commercial projects, however, we are offering lcms library
free for anybody under an extremely liberal open source license.
