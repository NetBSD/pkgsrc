   Cooledit is a full-featured text editor, for Unix computers that run
   the X Window System. Cooledit was born from a need for a user
   friendly text editor that would rival editors of other operating
   systems in ease of use and convenience. Lately Cooledit is also a
   powerful programmer's editor. It is also small and fast, making it
   ideal for interface with applications that allow for, or require, an
   external editor. See 'Features' in the man page for a more elaborate
   description of what Cooledit can do.
