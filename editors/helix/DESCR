Helix is a modal text editor with built-in support for multiple selections,
Language Server Protocol (LSP), tree-sitter, and experimental support for
Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP).  Its main features include:

 - Multiple cursors as a core editing primitive, inspired by Kakoune. Commands
   manipulate selections which allows concurrent code editing.

 - Tree-sitter produces error tolerant and robust syntax trees, which enables
   better syntax highlighting, indent calculation and code navigation.

 - Navigate and select functions, classes, comments, etc and select syntax
   tree nodes instead of plain text.

 - Language specific auto completion, goto definition, documentation,
   diagnostics and other IDE features with no additional configuration.

 - No Electron. No VimScript. No JavaScript. Use it over ssh, tmux, or a plain
   terminal. Your laptop battery life will thank you.

 - Fuzzy finder to jump to files and symbols, project wide search, beautiful
   themes, auto closing bracket pairs, surround integration and more.
