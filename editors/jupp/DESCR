This is the portable version of JOE.s Own Editord, using autoconf/automake.
This version has been enhanced by several functions intended for programmers
or other professional users, and has a lot of bugs fixed.
It is based upon an older version of joe because these behave better overall.

Basic differences between joe and jupp are:

* obviously, another flavour, jupp, similar to jstar
* utf-8 support on non-locale-aware OSses
* bug and security fixes
* tab completion fixes
* code cleanup
* compiles with -Wall -Werror (on MirBSD)
* improved options menu
* visibled spaces
