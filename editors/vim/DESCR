Vim is an almost compatible version of the UNIX editor Vi.  Many new features
have been added: multi level undo, syntax highlighting, command line history,
on-line help, filename completion, block operations, etc. See doc/vi_diff.txt.

If you are building the package from source you may want to enable some
features such as a perl or python interpreter which are not enabled by
default.

This version does not contain a gui. If you want one, look at vim-xaw, vim-gtk,
vim-gtk2 or vim-motif.
