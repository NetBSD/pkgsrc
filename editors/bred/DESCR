A simple binary file reader that dumps the output to stdout.

To use, simply input a file (stdin support coming soon), and add any desired
options.
 --length option changes how many characters to print (not including any
   formatting like offsets and borders).
 --chunk option changes how large the buffer array should be; the bigger it is,
   the faster but uses more memory.
 --hex option simply prints the file in hexadecimal.
 --color option uses colors to differentiate between letters (\0 are gray,
   others indicate how large the character code is, and orange is non-ascii
   characters). Note, make sure you use a terminal emulator that supports ANSI
   256-color mode.
 --space option replaces all the spaces (0x20) with a green-colored _.
   This also affects the hex output.
