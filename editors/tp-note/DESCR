Tp-Note is a note-taking-tool and a template system that consistently
synchronizes the notes meta-data with its filename.

If you like to keep your notes next to your files and you care about expressive
filenames, then Tp-Note might be the tool of your choice.
Tp-Note collects various information about its environment and the clipboard
and stores them in variables.
New notes are created by filling these variables in predefined and customizable
Tera-templates.

TP-Note's default templates are written in Markdown and can be easily adapted
to any other markup language if needed. After creating a new note, TP-Note
launches the system file editor (or any other of your choice, e.g. MarkText
or Typora) and connects the default web browser to Tp-Note's
internal Markdown/RestructuredText renderer and web server.
