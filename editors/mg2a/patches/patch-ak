+.Sh NAME
+.Nm mg
+.Nd an emacs clone (formerly named MicroGnuEmacs)
+.Sh SYNOPSIS
+.Nm
+.Op Ar file ...
+.Sh DESCRIPTION
+MG is a small, fast, and portable Emacs-style text editor intended to
+be used by people who can't run a real Emacs for one reason or another.
+.Pp
+We've made MG compatible with GNU Emacs because that is the big,
+full-featured editor that many use regularly and are most
+familiar with.
+.Pp
+MG runs on many different kinds of hardware under many different 
+operating systems.  A small and fast version compiled for MSDOS
+is available at ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/simtelnet/msdos/editor/mg2a_exe.zip.
+.Sh Notation and Conventions
+To type a control character, use the control key on your
+keyboard like a shift key:  hold down the control key while typing the
+character.  We will indicate control characters as: 
+C-x ie, type the character x while holding down the control key.
+.Pp
+Some keyboards also have a meta key that works like the control
+key.  You can also use the escape key as a meta
+prefix; first type the escape, and then the character.  Meta
+characters will be indicated as M-x.
+.Pp
+Besides the meta prefix, two other characters are used as prefixes:
+C-x and C-h.  A few keys have special notation:  SPC is
+the space character, DEL is the delete or rubout character, RET
+is carriage return, and ESC is the escape character.  NUL is 
+the null character (ASCII 0), which is usually equivalent to either 
+C-SPC or C-@.
+.Pp
+Uppercase and lowercase characters are generally equivalent in command
+keystrokes.
+.Pp
+When you run MG from a shell, command line arguments are interpreted as the
+names of files you want to visit, or edit.  Each file is 
+read into a buffer in memory.  No changes are actually made to 
+the file until you ask it to be written out to disk.
+.Pp
+Within MG, the large top part of the screen serves as a window into
+the buffer being edited.  Below this is the mode line, which 
+displays the name of the buffer.  Finally, at the very bottom of the screen,
+there is a one-line minibuffer which is used for displaying
+messages and answering questions.
+.Pp
+MG keeps track of two pointers into each window, the point and the
+mark.  The cursor appears at the point in the current
+window, and we often speak of moving the cursor rather than of moving the
+point.  The text between the point and the mark is referred to as the
+region.
+.Pp
+Some commands deal with words and paragraphs.
+Generally, whitespace and punctuation separate words.  Lines that are
+empty or that contain only spaces or tabs separate paragraphs without
+being part of a paragraph.  A non-empty line that starts with a space
+or tab also begins a new paragraph. 
+.Pp
+A number of commands are defined as toggles.  If no prefix argument
+is supplied, these commands toggle an action.  The action is turned on if a 
+negative or zero argument is supplied, and turned on if a positive argument
+is supplied.
+.Sh Frequently used commands
+.Pp
+C-p move the cursor to the previous line
+.Pp
+C-n move the cursor to the next line
+.Pp
+C-b move the cursor backwards
+.Pp
+C-f move the cursor forwards
+.Pp
+C-v scroll forwards one screenful
+.Pp
+M-v scroll backwards one screenful
+.Pp
+M-< go to the beginning of the buffer
+.Pp
+M-> go to the end of the buffer
+.Pp
+C-a go to the beginning of the line
+.Pp
+C-e go to the end of the line
+.Pp
+DEL delete the previous character
+.Pp
+C-k kill (delete) to the end of line
+.Pp
+C-y reinsert killed text.
+.Pp
+C-x C-c exit MG
+.Pp
+C-x C-s save the current buffer
+.Sh Command Arguments
+MG prompts for command arguments in the minibuffer.  Within the minibuffer,
+the following characters can be used for editing:
+.Pp
+DEL or C-h erase the last character. 
+.Pp
+C-x or C-u erase the entire input line. 
+.Pp
+C-w erase to the beginning of the previous word. 
+.Pp
+C-q or \\ quote the next character typed. 
+.Pp
+RET signifies that you have completed typing in the argument. 
+.Pp
+C-g abort the command in progress.
+.Sh Prefix Arguments
+All commands accept an optional numeric prefix argument.  This is
+often interpreted as a repetition count.  For example, the function
+next-line, if given a prefix argument, will move the cursor
+forward that many lines; without an argument, it will move the cursor
+forward one line.  A few commands behave differently if given a prefix
+argument than they do without one, and others ignore the prefix
+argument entirely. 
+.Bl -tag -width indent
+.It digit-argument, M-# & negative-argument, M--
+One way to specify a command argument is to use the escape key
+as a meta prefix, and then type one or more digits.  A dash may be
+used for a negative argument (# = 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9).
+.It universal-argument, C-u
+Another way to specify a command prefix is to type C-u.
+Typing one C-u is equivalent to a prefix argument of 4, typing
+two gives a value of 16, and so on.  In addition, you can type digits
+following C-u to form a numeric prefix argument.
+.Sh Aborting
+.It keyboard-quit, C-g
+Typing C-g cancels any command.  It is particularly useful
+for cancelling a command when MG is prompting for input in the minibuffer.
+.Sh Extended commands
+.It execute-extended-command, M-x
+Commands that are not bound to keys can be executed through 
+execute-extended-command.  If a prefix argument is supplied, it
+is passed to the command being executed.
+.Sh Moving the cursor
+.It backward-char, C-b
+Moves the cursor backward (left) one character.  If the cursor
+is at the left margin, it will be moved to the end of the previous line.
+.It backward-paragraph, M-[
+Moves the cursor backwards to the beginning of the current
+paragraph, or to the beginning of the previous paragraph if the cursor
+is already at the beginning of a paragraph.
+.It backward-word, M-b
+Moves the cursor backwards to the beginning of the current word,
+or to the beginning of the previous word if the cursor is already at
+the beginning of a word.
+.It beginning-of-buffer, M-<
+Moves the cursor backwards to the beginning of the buffer.
+.It beginning-of-line, C-a
+Moves the cursor backwards to the beginning of the current
+line.  This command has no effect if the cursor is already at the beginning
+of the line.
+.It end-of-buffer, M->
+Moves the cursor forwards to the end of the buffer.
+.It end-of-line, C-e
+Moves the cursor forwards to the end of the current line.  This
+command has no effect if the cursor is already at the end of the line.
+.It exchange-point-and-mark, C-x C-x
+Set the mark at the current cursor position, and move the cursor
+to the old location of the mark.
+.It forward-char, C-f
+Moves the cursor forwards one character.  If the cursor is at the
+end of a line, it will be moved to the first character on the next line.
+.It forward-paragraph, M-]
+Moves the cursor forwards to the next paragraph delimiter.
+.It forward-word, M-f
+Moves the cursor forwards to the end of the current word, or to
+the end of the next word if the cursor is already at the end of a word.
+.It goto-line
+Moves the cursor to the beginning of line the line number in
+the buffer.
+.It next-line, C-n
+Moves the cursor down one line.  The cursor remains in the same
+column unless it would be past the end of the line, in which case it is
+moved to the end of the line.  At the end of the buffer, C-n will
+create new lines.
+.It previous-line, C-p
+Moves the cursor up one line.    The cursor remains in the same
+column unless it would be past the end of the line, in which case it is
+moved to the end of the line.
+.It recenter, C-l
+Redraws the entire screen, scrolling the current window if necessary
+so that the cursor is near the center.  With a positive prefix argument 
+n, the window is scrolled so that the cursor is n lines
+from the top.  A negative prefix argument puts the cursor that many lines
+from the bottom of the window.
+.It redraw-display
+Redraws the entire screen, but never scrolls.
+.It scroll-down, M-v
+Scrolls the display down (moving backward through the
+buffer).  Without 
+an argument, it scrolls slightly less than one windowful.  A prefix argument
+scrolls that many lines.
+.It scroll-one-line-down & scroll-one-line-up
+These functions are similar to scroll-down and scroll-up, but when
+invoked without an argument, cause the display 
+to scroll by one line only.  These functions are enabled by defining the
+compile-time option GOSMACS.
+.It scroll-other-window, M-C-v
+Scrolls the other window forward as for scroll-up.
+.It scroll-up, C-v
+Scrolls the display up (moving forward through the buffer).  Without an
+an argument, it scrolls slightly less than one windowful.  A prefix argument
+scrolls that many lines.
+.It set-mark-command
+Set the mark at the current cursor position.
+.It what-cursor-position, C-x =
+Prints some information in the minibuffer about where the cursor is.
+.Sh Text Insertion Commands
+The usual way to insert text into a buffer is simply to type the
+characters.  The default binding for all of the printing characters
+self-insert-command causes them to be inserted literally at
+the cursor position. 
+.It insert
+Insert typed string into the current buffer at the cursor position.
+.It newline, RET
+Insert a line break into the current buffer at the cursor position,
+moving the cursor forward to the beginning of the new line.
+.It newline-and-indent, C-j
+Insert a line break into the current buffer at the cursor position,
+then add extra whitespace so that the cursor is aligned in the same
+column as the first non-whitespace character in the previous line.
+.It open-line, C-o
+Inserts a line break into the current buffer at the current position,
+but does not move the cursor forward.
+.It quoted-insert, C-q
+This command acts as a prefix to
+cancel the normal interpretation of the next keystroke.  If C-q
+is followed by one to three octal digits, it is interpreted as the
+code of the character to insert.  Otherwise a single key is read and
+the character typed is inserted into the buffer instead of interpreted
+as a command.  This is used for inserting literal control characters
+into a buffer. 
+.It self-insert-command
+This is the default binding for keys representing printable
+characters.  The character is inserted into the buffer at the cursor
+position, and the cursor moved forward.
+.Sh Killing, Deleting, and Moving Text
+When text is deleted, it is erased completely.  Killing text, on the
+other hand, moves it into a temporary storage area called the kill
+buffer.  The saved text in the kill buffer is erased when another
+block of text is killed.  Until then, however, you can retrieve text
+from the kill buffer.  This can be used to move or copy blocks of
+text, as well as to restore accidentally killed text.
+.It backward-kill-word, M-DEL
+Kill the text backwards from the cursor position to the beginning
+of the current word.  Typing M-DEL several times in succession 
+prepends each killed word to the kill buffer.
+.It copy-region-as-kill, M-w
+Copies the text in the region into the kill buffer, without removing
+it from the current buffer.
+.It delete-backward-char, DEL
+Deletes the character to the left of the cursor.
+.It delete-blank-lines, C-x C-o
+Deletes all blank lines after the current line, and if the current
+line is blank, deletes it and all blank lines preceeding it as well.
+.It delete-char, C-d
+Deletes the character underneath the cursor.
+.It delete-horizontal-space, M-backslash
+Deletes all spaces and tabs on either side of the cursor.
+.It just-one-space, M-SPC
+This is like delete-horizontal-space, except it leaves a single
+space at the cursor position.
+.It kill-line, C-k
+If no prefix argument is specified, this function kills text up
+to the next newline; or if the cursor is at the end of a line, the newline
+is killed.  A prefix argument specifies how many lines to kill.  Typing
+C-k several times in succession appends each line to the kill buffer.
+.It kill-paragraph
+This command kills the entire paragraph containing the cursor.
+If the cursor is positioned between paragraphs, the next paragraph is killed.
+.It kill-region, C-w
+The region (all text between point and mark) is killed.
+.It kill-word, M-d
+Text is killed forward from the cursor position to the next
+end of word.  If the cursor is at the end of the word, then the next
+word is killed.  Typing M-d several times appends the killed
+text to the kill buffer.
+.It yank, C-y
+Text is copied from the kill buffer into the current buffer at
+the cursor position.  The cursor is moved to the end of the inserted
+text.
+.Sh Searching and Replacing
+The ordinary search command in MG differs from that in many other editors
+in that it is incremental:  it begins searching as soon as you begin
+typing the search string, instead of waiting for you to type the entire
+string.  All of the search commands described in this section are
+case-insensitive.
+.It isearch-backward, C-r & isearch-forward, C-s
+These commands perform an incremental search backward and 
+forward, respectively, for a typed pattern.  MG will move the cursor 
+to the place in the buffer that matches as much of the pattern as you 
+have typed so far, as each character is entered.
+.Pp
+Within the incremental search, the following characters are interpreted
+specially:
+.Pp
+\ DEL Erase the last character in the search string. 
+.Pp
+\ ESC Stop searching; exit from incremental search
+mode, leaving the cursor where the search brought it. 
+.Pp
+\ C-g If a match has been found, exits from
+incremental search but leaves the cursor in its original position.  If
+the search has failed, this will just erase the characters which have
+not been found from the end of the search pattern.  In this case, you
+must type C-g again to abort the search. 
+.Pp
+\ C-s Search forward for the next occurrence of the
+same pattern. 
+.Pp
+\ C-r Search backward for the previous occurrence of
+the same pattern. 
+.Pp
+\ C-q Quotes the next character typed, forcing it
+to be interpreted as a literal character in the search pattern.
+.Pp
+In addition, normal commands such as C-a that do not have special
+meanings within incremental search cause the search to be terminated, and
+then are executed in the ordinary way.
+.It search-again & search-backward, M-r & search-forward, M-s
+These commands perform ordinary, non-incremental searches.
+Search-again uses the same pattern and direction as the previous
+search.
+.Sh Replacing
+.It query-replace, M-%
+The primary replace command in MG is an interactive query replace.
+MG searches forward for occurrences of pattern, and asks you what
+to do about each one.  The choices are:
+.Pp
+SPC Replace this match with replacement,
+and go on to the next. 
+.Pp
+DEL Skip to the next match without replacing this one. 
+.Pp
+\ . Replace this match, and then quit. 
+.Pp
+! Replace all remaining occurrences without asking again. 
+.Pp
+ESC Quit.
+.Pp
+By default, query-replace adjusts the case of lower-case letters
+in the replacement string to match that of the
+particular occurrence of the pattern; for example, replacing Foo
+with bar results in Bar.  Upper case letters in the replacement
+string are always left uppercase.   In addition, supplying a prefix argument
+will also tell query-replace to leave the case of the replacement
+string as-is.
+.Pp
+Note that query-replace always performs a case-insensitive search.
+.Sh Regular Expressions
+Regular expressions provide a means for specifying complex search
+patterns, instead of just a literal string.  The commands in this
+section are available only if MG is compiled with the REGEX option
+defined. 
+.Pp
+Regular expression syntax uses the following rules.  Most characters
+in a regular expression are considered to be ordinary characters,
+and will match themselves and nothing else.  The exceptions are the
+special characters listed below.
+.Pp
+\ . Matches any single character except a newline.  
+.Pp
+* A suffix operator that matches zero or more
+repetitions of the (smallest) preceding regular expression. 
+.Pp
++ A suffix operator that matches one or more
+repetitions of the (smallest) preceding regular expression. 
+.Pp
+? A suffix operator that matches either zero or one
+occurence of the (smallest) preceding regular expression. 
+.Pp
+[...] Matches any one character listed in the
+character set between the square brackets.  See examples below. 
+.Pp
+^ Matches at the beginning of a line. 
+.Pp
+dollar Matches at the end of a line. 
+.Pp
+\\ Except for the situations listed
+below, acts as a prefix operator which causes the character following
+to be treated as an ordinary character. 
+.Pp
+\\bar An infix binary or operator.
+It applies to the two largest surrounding expressions. 
+.Pp
+\\(...\\) A grouping construct,
+usually used to specify a larger expression for postfix operators such
+as * or to limit the scope of operands to \|. 
+.Pp
+\\# Matches the same text
+matched by the #_th \\(...\\) construct.  These are
+numbered from 1 to 9 in the order that the open-parentheses appear. 
+.It count-matches & count-non-matches
+These commands count the number of lines which do or do not
+(respectively) match the specified pattern.
+.It delete-matching-lines & delete-non-matching-lines
+These commands delete all lines which do or do not (respectively)
+match the specified pattern.
+.It query-replace-regexp
+This is the regular expression version of query-replace.
+The replacement string may be a constant, or it can refer to
+all or part of the string matched by the pattern.  \& in
+the replacement string expands into the entire text being replaced,
+while n (where n is a number) replaces the 
+n_th parenthesized expression in pattern.
+.It re-search-again & re-search-backward & re-search-forward
+These are the regular expression equivalents of the ordinary
+non-incremental search commands.
+.It set-case-fold-search
+This command toggles an internal variable that controls whether
+the regular expression search and replace commands pay attention to
+case.  By default, regular expression searches are case-insensitive.
+Ordinary searches are always case-insensitive and are not affected by
+the setting of this variable.
+.Pp
+See the latex version for the documentation for better description.
+.Sh Windows
+MG initially has only one text window displayed.  However, you can have
+as many windows as will fit on the screen.  Each window has its own mode
+line and must display at least two lines of text.  (Note that MG's
+windows are distinct from the windows handled by screen managers
+such as the X Window System.)
+.Pp
+Multiple windows may be used to display different buffers.  You can also
+have the same buffer displayed in more than one window, which is useful
+if you want to see one part of a file at the same time as you are editing
+another part.
+.Pp
+Although many windows can be displayed at once, only one window is active 
+at any given time.  This is the window where the cursor appears.
+.Pp
+Some commands refer to the other window.  This is the window directly
+below the current window, or the top window if you are in the bottom window.
+.It delete-other-windows, C-x 1
+Makes the current window the only window.
+.It delete-window, C-x 0
+Deletes the current window, making the other window the
+current window.  This command doesn't do anything useful if there is only
+one window being displayed.
+.It enlarge-window C-^
+Makes the current window larger.  Without a prefix argument, the
+window grows one line; otherwise, the prefix argument specifies how many
+lines to grow.
+.It other-window, C-x o
+Makes the other window the current window.
+.It previous-window
+This is like other-window, except that it cycles through
+the windows in reverse order.  This command is available only if MG was
+compiled with the GOSMACS option defined.
+.It shrink-window
+Makes the current window smaller.  Without a prefix argument, the
+window loses one line; otherwise, the prefix argument specifies how many
+lines go away.
+.It split-window-vertically, C-x 2
+Split the current window into two windows, both using the same
+buffer.
+.Sh Files and Buffers
+Most buffers are used to contain a file being edited.  It is
+also possible to have buffers that are not associated with any file;
+MG uses these for purposes such as displaying help text, for example.
+However, since most commands for dealing with files also deal with
+buffers, we have grouped all of these commands together into one chapter.
+.It insert-buffer
+Inserts the contents of the named buffer into the current buffer
+at the cursor location.  The cursor moves to the end of the inserted
+text.
+.It kill-buffer C-x k
+The named buffer and its contents are deleted.  If the buffer has
+been marked as modified, MG will ask you if you really want to delete it.
+Note that, contrary to its name, this command does not save the
+buffer contents in the kill buffer.
+If a buffer is being displayed in a window when it is deleted, MG will 
+find some other buffer to display in the same window.
+.It list-buffers, C-x C-b
+This command writes information about the buffers currently in
+use to a buffer named Buffer List.  This buffer is then displayed
+in the other window; if there is only one window, this command will
+split the screen into two windows.
+.It not-modified, M-~
+This command makes MG think that the current buffer has not been
+modified, even if it really has been changed.  This affects the behavior
+of the kill-buffer and the buffer-saving commands described below.
+.Pp
+MG indicates modified buffers with two stars at the left end of the mode
+line.
+.It switch-to-buffer, C-x b
+The current window is mapped onto the named buffer.  If there
+isn't already a buffer with that name around, MG will create one.
+.It switch-to-buffer-other-window, C-x 4 b
+This command works like switch-to-buffer, except that the
+other window is used.  If there is only one window, this command
+splits the screen into two windows and maps the named buffer onto one
+of them.
+.Sh Reading and Writing Files
+.It find-file C-x f & find-file-other-window C-x 4 C-f
+These commands are analagous to switch-to-buffer and
+switch-to-buffer-other-window, respectively.  The difference is that
+these commands look for a buffer associated with the named file.  If no
+matching buffer is found, MG will create a new buffer with a name
+derived from the filename, and attempt to read the file into the buffer.
+If the named file cannot be opened, the buffer remains empty.
+.It insert-file C-x i
+This command reads in the contents of the named file into the
+current buffer at the cursor position.  The cursor remains in the same
+place.
+.It save-buffer, C-x C-s
+If the current buffer has been modified, it is saved.  Buffers
+that are not associated with files cannot be written out with this
+command.
+.It save-buffers-kill-emacs, C-x C-c
+This command is used to leave MG and return control to the shell
+or other program that was used to start MG.  If there are modified buffers,
+MG will ask you if you want to save them before exiting.
+.It save-some-buffers, C-x s
+MG will ask you if you want to save modified buffers that are
+associated with files.
+.It write-file C-x C-w
+The current buffer is written out using the file name supplied.
+This is useful for saving buffers that are not associated with files, or
+for writing out a file with a different name than what was used to read
+it in.
+.Sh Backup Files
+MG provides a way to save a copy of the original version of files which 
+have been modified and then written out again.  The backup copy reflects
+the state of the file as it existed the first time it was read into MG.
+The name used for the backup file varies, depending on the operating
+system.
+.Pp
+This feature is disabled if MG is compiled with NO_BACKUP defined.
+.It make-backup-files
+This command is a toggle which
+controls the state of an internal variable that determines whether MG
+creates backup files. 
+.Sh Changing the Directory
+The commands in this section are disabled by defining NO_DIR.
+.It cd
+This command changes MG's notion of the current directory
+or pathname.  This is used to supply defaults for functions that read 
+or write files.
+.It pwd
+Display what MG thinks is the current directory.
+.Sh Modes
+Modes are used to locally alter the bindings of keys on a 
+buffer-by-buffer basis.  MG is normally in fundamental mode, and these
+are the bindings that are listed with the command descriptions in 
+this manual.  Modes define additional keymaps that are searched for
+bindings before the fundamental mode bindings are examined; see the
+section on key binding below for more details on how this works.
+.It set-default-mode
+Normally, when MG visits a file, it puts the associated buffer
+into fundamental mode.  Using the set-default-mode command, you
+can specify that MG should default to use some other mode on all subsequent
+buffers that are created.  This command is a toggle.  With no prefix
+argument, if the named mode is not already on the list of
+default modes, then it will be added to the list; otherwise, it is removed
+from the list.
+.It no-tab-mode
+This command is a toggle to control whether notab mode is in effect.
+In notab mode, tabs are expanded into spaces instead of inserted
+literally into the buffer.  Literal tab characters are displayed as
+^I (much like other control characters).  These commands are
+available if MG is compiled with the symbol NOTAB defined.  (This mode
+is mainly for use on systems such as PRIMOS that do not treat tab as a
+series of spaces.)
+.It space-to-tabstop
+Insert enough spaces to move the cursor to the next tab stop.  In
+notab mode, this function is bound to C-i.
+.It overwrite-mode
+This command is a toggle which controls whether overwrite mode is
+in effect.
+Normally, when characters are inserted into the buffer, they are spliced
+into the existing text.  In overwrite mode, inserting a character causes
+the character already at the cursor position to be replaced.  This is
+useful for editing pictures, tables, and the like.
+.It auto-fill-mode
+This command is a toggle which controls whether fill mode is
+in effect.
+Fill mode causes newlines to be added automatically at word
+breaks when text is added at the end of a line, extending past the
+right margin.  Auto fill is useful for editing text and documentation
+files.
+.It insert-with-wrap
+This command works like self-insert, except that it checks
+to see if the cursor has passed the right margin.  If so, it fills
+the line by inserting a line break between words.  This command is bound to 
+SPC in fill mode.
+.It fill-paragraph, M-q
+Fill the paragraph containing the cursor.
+.It set-fill-column, C-x f
+Without a prefix argument, this command sets the right margin
+at the current cursor column.  If a prefix argument is supplied, it is used
+instead as the line width.
+.It auto-indent-mode
+This command is a toggle which controls whether auto-indent mode
+is in effect.
+Indent mode binds RET to newline-and-indent, so
+that each new line is indented to the same level as the preceeding
+line.  This mode is useful for editing code. 
+.It blink-matching-paren
+This command is a toggle which controls whether blink mode is
+in effect.
+Blink mode makes it easier to match parentheses, brackets, and other
+paired delimiters.  When the closing delimiter is typed, the cursor
+moves momentarily to the matching opening delimiter (if it is on the
+screen), or displays the line containing the matching delimiter on the
+echo line.  This is useful for editing Lisp or C code, or for
+preparing input files for text processors such as LaTeX that use
+paired delimiters. 
+.It blink-matching-paren-hack
+This function behaves like self-insert, except that it
+finds the matching delimiter as described above.  In blink mode, this
+function is bound to ), which flashes the matching (.  This
+function also knows about the pairs {}, [], and <>.
+All other characters match with themselves.
+.Sh Dired Mode
+Dired is an abbreviation for directory editor, and it provides a way
+to browse through the contents of a directory from with MG.  Dired puts
+a directory listing into a buffer; you can use normal editing commands to
+move around the buffer, and a special group of commands to manipulate
+the files.  For example, there are commands to delete and rename files,
+and to read a file into an MG buffer.
+.Pp
+Since dired mode rebinds many keys, a table may be helpful:
+.Pp
+    C-d      dired-flag-file-deleted
+.Pp
+    SPC      next-line
+.Pp
+    c        dired-copy-file
+.Pp
+    d        dired-flag-file-deleted
+.Pp
+    e        dired-find-file
+.Pp
+    f        dired-find-file
+.Pp
+    n        next-line
+.Pp
+    o        dired-find-file-other-window
+.Pp
+    p        previous-line
+.Pp
+    r        dired-renamefile
+.Pp
+    u        dired-unflag
+.Pp
+    x        dired-do-deletions
+.Pp
+    DEL      dired-backup-unflag
+.Pp
+The commands in this section are disabled by defining NO_DIRED.
+.It dired C-x d
+Creates a dired buffer for the given directory name, and displays
+it in the current window.  The files
+in the directory are listed, usually along with information about the
+file such as its size and timestamp.  The exact format of the information
+is system-specific.
+.It dired-backup-unflag
+This function removes the deletion flag from the file listed on
+the previous line of the dired buffer.
+.It dired-copy-file
+Copy the file listed on the current line of the dired buffer.
+.It dired-do-deletions
+Deletes the files that have been flagged for deletion.
+.It dired-find-file & dired-find-file-other-window
+These function works like find-file and find-file-other-window,
+except that the filename is taken 
+from the current line in the dired buffer.
+.It dired-flag-file-deleted
+Flag the file listed on the current line for deletion.  This is
+indicated in the buffer by putting a D at the left margin.  No
+files are not actually deleted until the function dired-do-deletions
+is executed.
+.It dired-other-window
+This function works just like dired, except that it puts the
+dired buffer in the other window.
+.It dired-rename-file
+Renames the file listed on the current line of the dired buffer.  
+Note that the dired buffer is not updated to reflect the change.
+.It dired-unflag
+Remove the deletion flag for the file on the current line.
+.Sh Help
+Most of the commands in this section write useful information to the
+*help* buffer, which is then displayed in the other window.
+.Pp
+These commands can be disabled at compile-time by defining NO_HELP.
+.It apropos, C-h a
+This command lists all functions whose names contain a string
+matching topic in the help buffer.
+.It describe-bindings, C-h b
+Information about the key bindings in effect in the current buffer
+is listed in the help buffer.
+.It describe-key-briefly, C-h c
+Information about the binding of ke is printed in the
+minibuffer.
+.It help-help, C-h C-h
+This command lists all of the help options available and
+prompts for which one to run.  Currently, these include only a
+to run apropos, b to run describe-bindings, and c
+to run describe-key-briefly.
+.Sh Keyboard Macros
+A keyboard macro is a saved set of commands from the keyboard that can be
+reexecuted later on.  There can only be one keyboard macro defined at
+any one time.
+.Pp
+The commands in this section are available unless they have been disabled
+by defining NO_MACRO.
+.It call-last-kbd-macro, C-x e
+Execute the saved keyboard macro.  A prefix argument can be used
+to specify a repetition count.
+.It end-kbd-macro, C-x ) & start-kbd-macro, C-x (
+These functions are used to define a keyboard macro.  All keys
+entered after start-kbd-macro is executed, up to a end-kbd-macro,
+are remembered as they are executed.  You can then reexecute the same
+sequence of operations using call-last-kbd-macro.
+.Sh Changing Case
+MG provides a number of functions for changing the case of text.
+.It
+capitalize-word, M-c
+.It
+downcase-region, C-x C-l
+.It
+downcase-word, M-l
+.It
+upcase-region, C-x C-u
+.It
+upcase-word, M-u
+.Sh Odds and Ends
+This section describes miscellaneous commands that don't fit into any
+particular category.
+.It emacs-version
+Prints information about the version of MG you are running in
+the minibuffer.
+.It meta-key-mode
+If the particular version of MG you are running supports a meta key,
+this function can be used to determine whether MG actually pays attention
+to it or not.  If no prefix argument is supplied, the internal variable
+that controls the use of the meta key is toggled; a positive value enables
+the meta key, while a negative value disables it.
+.It prefix-region & set-prefix-string
+Prefix-region is used to prefix each line of the region
+with a string.  This is useful for indenting quoted text, making block
+comments, and the like.  The function set-prefix-string can be
+used to set the string used as the prefix.
+.It suspend-emacs, C-z
+This command temporarily suspends
+MG so that you can run other programs, and later resume editing.  The
+exact behavior depends on which operating system you are running MG
+under.  Typically, MG will either spawn a new shell as a subprocess, or
+return you to the parent process.
+.It transpose-chars, C-t
+This command transposes the previous two characters.
+.Sh Customization
+MG provides a limited support for customization.  However, unlike real 
+Emacs, there is no extension language for interpretively defining new 
+functions.
+.Sh Key Bindings
+MG allows keys to be rebound locally or globally.  To understand the
+difference between the two, some discussion on how modes are implemented
+is necessary.
+.Pp
+An internal data structure called a keymap is used to look up the
+function that is bound to a particular key.  The keymap for
+fundamental mode contains all of the default bindings which are listed
+with the command descriptions in this manual.  Modes define additional
+keymaps that are searched for a binding before the fundamental mode
+keymap is examined.  Keymaps have the same name as the mode they are
+associated with.
+.Pp
+MG does not provide commands for defining new modes, but you can alter
+the keymaps for existing modes.
+.It define-key
+This command can be used to modify the keymap for the named mode.
+.It global-set-key & global-unset-key
+These commands modify the keymap for fundamental mode.  Bindings
+established by global-set-key will be inherited by all other modes, 
+as long as they do not establish local rebindings of the same key.
+.It local-set-key & local-unset-key
+These commands modify the keymap currently in effect.
+.Sh Startup Files
+Although MG does not include a general-purpose extension language, it
+does provide a way to read and evaluate commands using a somewhat
+different syntax than that used for executing extended commands.  This
+is typically used in a startup file to modify key bindings.
+.Pp
+A startup file consists of one or more expressions.  Each expression must
+appear on a separate line in the file; there may not be more than one
+expression per line, nor may expressions span across line breaks.
+Whitespace (spaces and tabs) separate the tokens in an expression.  For
+historical reasons, parentheses are also considered to be whitespace in
+this context.  A semicolon acts as a comment character, causing the rest
+of the line to be discarded.
+.Pp
+An expression consists of a function name, an optional prefix argument
+(given as an integer constant), and arguments to be passed to the
+function.  If an argument includes literal whitespace or nonprintable
+characters (for example, as in a keystroke argument to one of the key
+binding functions described in the previous section), it must be
+supplied as a string constant enclosed in double quotes. 
+.Pp
+The following commands which deal with evaluation of expressions are
+disabled by defining the compile-time option NO_STARTUP.  See the
+implementation notes for your particular version of MG for information
+on how it handles startup files. 
+.It eval-current-buffer
+Evaluate the expressions in the current buffer.
+.It eval-expression
+Evaluate the expression supplied.
+.It load
+Read in the specified file and evaluate its contents.

+.Sh Bugs and Limitations
+Some listed in the LaTeX documentation.  A few path-length issues,

+.Sh History
+The original authors of mg2a were 
+Bob Larson, Mic Kaczmarczik, Mike Meyer, Sandra Loosemore,
+Michael Portuesi, Stephen Walton, Marion Hakanson, Dave Brower,
+Jeff Siegal, and John P. Nelson.
+It was posted to the comp.sources.misc mailing list of Usenet
+sometime around 1988. Original sources
+available at ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/c-unix/editors/mg2a.tar.Z
+or in ftp://www.leo.org/pub/comp/usenet/comp.sources.misc/mg2a.
+.Pp
+Modified for NetBSD by John P. Refling as follows:
+.Pp
+December 1999 (version 1.00)
+.Pp
+Port to NetBSD (not much to do there) and a change to the
+mg.rc startup file name and search paths (searches the directory
+where the executable is first).
+Also hastily turned the LaTeX documentation written by Sandra J
+Loosemore in 1987 into this manpage.
+.Pp
+January 2000 (version 1.10):
+.Pp
+Journaling:
+if a subdirectory named .journal exists in the directory of the
+edited file fn, the edited file is copied into the .journal
+subdirectory as fn-@# before the new version is written out.
+The # is the system time in seconds since January 1, 1970.
+This feature creates a transparent backup chain of all files
+edited within a selected directory.  If the edited file did not exist
+at the start of the editing session, a zero length fn-@# file is created.
+.Pp
+If the environment variable MG_DOT_ORIG is set, then the edited
+file fn is copied to a fn.orig file, only if a fn.orig file does not already exist.
+Helpful for creating diffs.  If the edit file itself does not exist
+prior to the editing session, a fn.orig file is touched.
+.Pp
+All these actions are indicated in the information bar when the
+file is being saved: `Wrote (o+j) filename....' o indicates that a
+fn.orig was created, and j indicates that a time stamped copy was
+made in the .journal directory.
