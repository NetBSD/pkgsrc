gedit is a small and lightweight UTF-8 text editor.  It is part of
GNOME and uses the latest GTK+ and GNOME libraries.  Complete GNOME
integration is featured, with support for Drag and Drop (DnD) from
Nautilus (the GNOME file manager), the use of the GNOME help system,
the GNOME Virtual File System and the GNOME print framework.

gedit uses a Multiple Document Interface (MDI), which lets you edit
more than one document at the same time.  It supports most standard
editing features, plus several not found in your average text editor
(plugins being the most notable of these).  Plugins may also be
written in the python scripting language: to enable python support
you need the pygtk and gnome-python-desktop bindings.
