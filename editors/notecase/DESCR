NoteCase is a hierarchical note manager (aka. outliner). It helps you
organize your everyday text notes into a single document, with
individual notes placed in the tree-like structure (each note can have
its sub-notes, ...).
To ensure your privacy, encrypted document format is supported,
along with standard unencrypted format.
