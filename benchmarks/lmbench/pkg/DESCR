         lmbench is a micro-benchmark suite designed to focus attention
      on the basic building blocks of many common system  applications,
      such  as  databases,  simulations, software development, and
      networking.  In almost all  cases,  the  individual  tests  are
      the result  of  analysis and isolation of a customer's actual
      performance problem.  These tools can be, and currently  are,
      used  to compare  different system implementations from different
      vendors.  The tools have been and continue to be used by processor
      designers.  In  several  cases,  the  benchmarks  have  uncovered
      previously unknown  bugs  and design flaws.  lmbench  includes an
      extensible database of results from systems current as of late 1995.
