LINPACK is a collection of Fortran subroutines that analyze and solve
linear equations and linear least-squares problems. The package solves
linear systems whose matrices are general, banded, symmetric indefinite,
symmetric positive definite, triangular, and tridiagonal square. In
addition, the package computes the QR and singular value decompositions of
rectangular matrices and applies them to least-squares problems. LINPACK
uses column-oriented algorithms to increase efficiency by preserving
locality of reference. 

LINPACK was designed for supercomputers in use in the 1970s and early
1980s. LINPACK has been largely superceded by LAPACK, which has been
designed to run efficiently on shared-memory, vector supercomputers.
