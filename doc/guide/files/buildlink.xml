  <title>Buildlink methodology</title>

  <para>Buildlink is a framework in pkgsrc that controls what headers and libraries
  are seen by a package's configure and build processes.  This is implemented
  in a two step process:</para>

  <orderedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>Symlink headers and libraries for dependencies into
      <varname>BUILDLINK_DIR</varname>, which by default is a subdirectory
      of <varname>WRKDIR</varname>.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>Create wrapper scripts that are used in place of the normal compiler
      tools that translate <option>-I${LOCALBASE}/include</option> and
      <option>-L${LOCALBASE}/lib</option> into references to
      <varname>BUILDLINK_DIR</varname>. The wrapper scripts also make
      native compiler on some operating systems look like GCC, so that
      packages that expect GCC won't require modifications to build with
      those native compilers.</para>
    </listitem>
  </orderedlist>

  <para>This normalizes the environment in which a package is built so that the
  package may be built consistently despite what other software may be
  installed. Please note that the normal system header and library paths,
  e.g. <filename>/usr/include</filename>,
  <filename>/usr/lib</filename>, etc., are always searched -- buildlink3 is
  designed to insulate the package build from non-system-supplied
  software.</para>

  <sect1 id="converting-to-buildlink3">
    <title>Converting packages to use buildlink3</title>

    <para>The process of converting packages to use the buildlink3
    framework (<quote>bl3ifying</quote>) is fairly straightforward.
    The things to keep in mind are:</para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>Ensure that the build always calls the wrapper scripts
	instead of the actual toolchain.  Some packages are tricky,
	and the only way to know for sure is the check
	<filename>${WRKDIR}/.work.log</filename> to see if the
	wrappers are being invoked.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Don't override <varname>PREFIX</varname> from within
	the package Makefile, e.g. Java VMs, standalone shells,
	etc., because the code to symlink files into
	<filename>${BUILDLINK_DIR}</filename> looks for files
	relative to <quote>pkg_info -qp <replaceable>pkgname</replaceable></quote>.
	</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Remember that <emphasis>only</emphasis> the
	<filename>buildlink3.mk</filename> files that you list in a
	package's Makefile are added as dependencies for that package.
	</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>

    <para>If a dependency on a particular package is required for its libraries and
    headers, then we replace:</para>

<programlisting>
DEPENDS+=       foo>=1.1.0:../../category/foo
</programlisting>

    <para>with</para>

<programlisting>
.include "../../category/foo/buildlink3.mk"
</programlisting>

    <para>The buildlink3.mk files usually define the required dependencies.
    If you need a newer version of the dependency when using buildlink3.mk
    files, then you can define it in your Makefile; for example:</para>

<programlisting>
BUILDLINK_API_DEPENDS.foo+=   foo>=1.1.0
.include "../../category/foo/buildlink3.mk"
</programlisting>

    <para>There are several <filename>buildlink3.mk</filename>
    files in <filename>pkgsrc/mk</filename>
    that handle special package issues:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para><filename>bdb.buildlink3.mk</filename> chooses either
	the native or a pkgsrc Berkeley DB implementation based on
	the values of <varname>BDB_ACCEPTED</varname> and
	<varname>BDB_DEFAULT</varname>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><filename>curses.buildlink3.mk</filename>: If the system
	comes with neither Curses nor NCurses, this will take care
	to install the <filename

      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><filename>krb5.buildlink3.mk</filename> uses the value
	of <varname>KRB5_ACCEPTED</varname> to choose between
	adding a dependency on Heimdal or MIT-krb5 for packages that
	require a Kerberos 5 implementation.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><filename>motif.buildlink3.mk</filename> checks for a
	system-provided Motif installation or adds a dependency on
	<filename role="pkg">x11/lesstif</filename> or <filename

	<varname>MOTIF_TYPE</varname> to <quote>dt</quote>,
	<quote>lesstif</quote> or <quote>motif</quote>
	to choose which Motif version will be used.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><filename>readline.buildlink3.mk</filename> checks for a
	system-provided GNU readline or editline (libedit) installation,
	or adds a dependency on <filename role="pkg">devel/readline</filename>,
	<filename role="pkg">devel/editline</filename>. The user can set
	<varname>READLINE_DEFAULT</varname> to choose readline implementation.
	If your package really needs GNU readline library, its Makefile
	should include <filename>devel/readline/buildlink3.mk</filename>
	instead of <filename>readline.buildlink3.mk</filename>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><filename>oss.buildlink3.mk</filename> defines several

    <para>A package's <filename>buildlink3.mk</filename> file is
    included by Makefiles to indicate the need to compile and link
    against header files and libraries provided by the package.  A
    <filename>buildlink3.mk</filename> file should always provide
    enough information to add the correct type of dependency
    relationship and include any other
    <filename>buildlink3.mk</filename> files that it needs to find
    headers and libraries that it needs in turn.</para>

    <para>To generate an initial <filename>buildlink3.mk</filename>
    file for further editing, Rene Hexel's <filename
    role="pkg">pkgtools/createbuildlink</filename>
    package is highly recommended.  For most packages, the following
    command will generate a good starting point for
    <filename>buildlink3.mk</filename> files:</para>

      <para>The main section is protected from multiple inclusion

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para><varname>BUILDLINK_API_DEPENDS.<replaceable>pkg</replaceable></varname>
	  is the dependency version recorded in the installed

	  variable should be set to the last version of the
	  package that had an backwards-incompatible API change.
	  </para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><varname>BUILDLINK_PKGSRCDIR.<replaceable>pkg</replaceable></varname>
	  is the location of the <replaceable>pkg</replaceable>
	  pkgsrc directory.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><varname>BUILDLINK_DEPMETHOD.<replaceable>pkg</replaceable></varname>
	  (not shown above) controls whether we use
	  <varname>BUILD_DEPENDS</varname> or
	  <varname>DEPENDS</varname> to add the dependency on
	  <replaceable>pkg</replaceable>.  The build dependency is
	  selected by setting

      <para>The following variables are all optionally defined within

      <para>This section can additionally include any
      <filename>buildlink3.mk</filename> needed for
      <replaceable>pkg</replaceable>'s library dependencies.
      Including these <filename>buildlink3.mk</filename> files
      means that the headers and libraries for these
      dependencies are also symlinked into
      <filename>${BUILDLINK_DIR}</filename>
      whenever the <replaceable>pkg</replaceable>
      <filename>buildlink3.mk</filename>
      file is included. Dependencies are only added for directly

      <para>When providing a <filename>buildlink3.mk</filename> and
      including other <filename>buildlink3.mk</filename> files in it,
      please only add necessary ones, i.e., those whose libraries or
      header files are automatically exposed when the package is
      use.</para>

      <para>In particular, if only an executable
      (<filename>bin/foo</filename>) is linked against a library, that
      library does not need to be propagated in the
      <filename>buildlink3.mk</filename> file.</para>

      <para>The following steps should help you decide if a

	<listitem><para>Look at the installed header files: What
	headers do they include? The packages providing these files
	must be buildlinked.</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>Run <filename>ldd</filename> on all installed
	libraries and look against what other libraries they link.
	Some of the packages providing these probably need to be
	buildlinked; however, it's not automatic, since e.g. GTK on
	some systems pulls in the X libraries, so they will show up in
	the <filename>ldd</filename> output, while on others (like OS
	X) it won't. <filename>ldd</filename> output can thus only be
	used as a hint.</para></listitem>

      <varname>BUILDLINK_ABI_DEPENDS.<replaceable>pkg</replaceable></varname>
      in <filename>buildlink3.mk</filename> files</title>

      <para>Both variables set lower bounds for a version of this package.
      The two variables differ in that one describes source
      compatibility (API) and the other binary compatibility (ABI).
      The difference is that a change in the API breaks compilation of
      programs while changes in the ABI stop compiled programs from
      running.</para>

      <para>The
      <varname>BUILDLINK_API_DEPENDS.<replaceable>pkg</replaceable></varname>
      variable in a <filename>buildlink3.mk</filename> should be
      changed very rarely.  (One possible scenario: If all packages
      using this package need a higher version than defined in the
      <filename>buildlink3.mk</filename>,
      <varname>BUILDLINK_API_DEPENDS.<replaceable>pkg</replaceable></varname>
      could be updated to that higher version.)</para>

      <para>On the other hand, changes to
      <varname>BUILDLINK_ABI_DEPENDS.<replaceable>pkg</replaceable></varname>
      are more common.  The variable will need to be updated every
      time the major version of one of its shared libraries is changed,
      or any other change where a binary built against the previous
      version of the package will not run against the new version any
      longer.</para>

      <para>In such a case, the package's
      <varname>BUILDLINK_ABI_DEPENDS.<replaceable>pkg</replaceable></varname>
      must be increased to require the new package version.  Then the
      <varname>PKGREVISION</varname> of all packages
      <replaceable>foo</replaceable> that depend on this package need
      to be increased, and if they have
      <filename>buildlink3.mk</filename> files,
      <varname>BUILDLINK_ABI_DEPENDS.<replaceable>foo</replaceable></varname>
      in their <filename>buildlink3.mk</filename> files must be
      increased to the new version as well. This is required so that a
      package will pull in the versions of the packages that use the
      new ABI and that the packages' <varname>PKGREVISION</varname>s
      uniquely identify the packages built against the new ABI. The
      <filename role="pkg">pkgtools/revbump</filename> package can
      help with these updates.</para>

      <para>See <xref linkend="dependencies"/> for more information
      about dependencies on other packages, including the
      <varname>BUILDLINK_API_DEPENDS</varname> definitions.</para>

      <para>Please take careful consideration before adjusting
      <varname>BUILDLINK_API_DEPENDS.<replaceable>pkg</replaceable></varname>
      or
      <varname>BUILDLINK_ABI_DEPENDS.<replaceable>pkg</replaceable></varname>
      in a <filename>buildlink3.mk</filename> file as we don't want to
      cause unneeded package deletions and rebuilds.  In many cases,
      new versions of packages work just fine with older
      dependencies.</para>

      <para>Also, it is not needed to set
      <varname>BUILDLINK_ABI_DEPENDS.<replaceable>pkg</replaceable></varname>
      when it is identical to
      <varname>BUILDLINK_API_DEPENDS.<replaceable>pkg</replaceable></varname>.</para>

      <para>Note there is also the distinction that users are able to disable
      enforcement of ABI dependencies using the <varname>USE_ABI_DEPENDS</varname>
      variable, but there is no equivalent option for API dependencies.</para>

      is <quote>no</quote> because we may make the determination
      that the built-in version of the software is similar enough to
      be used as a replacement.</para>

      <para>The last section is guarded by
      <varname>CHECK_BUILTIN.<replaceable>pkg</replaceable></varname>,
      and includes code that uses the value of
      <varname>USE_BUILTIN.<replaceable>pkg</replaceable></varname>
      set in the previous section.  This typically includes, e.g.,
      adding additional dependency restrictions and listing additional
      files to symlink into <filename>${BUILDLINK_DIR}</filename> (via
      <varname>BUILDLINK_FILES.<replaceable>pkg</replaceable></varname>).</para>

      <title>Global preferences for native or pkgsrc software</title>

      <para>When building packages, it's possible to choose whether to set
	a global preference for using either the built-in (native)
	version or the pkgsrc version of software to satisfy a
	dependency.  This is controlled by setting
	<varname>PREFER_PKGSRC</varname> and
	<varname>PREFER_NATIVE</varname>.  These variables take values
	of either <quote>yes</quote>, <quote>no</quote>, or a list of
	packages.  <varname>PREFER_PKGSRC</varname> tells pkgsrc to
	use the pkgsrc versions of software, while
	<varname>PREFER_NATIVE</varname> tells pkgsrc to use the
	built-in versions.  Preferences are determined by the most
	specific instance of the package in either
	<varname>PREFER_PKGSRC</varname> or
	<varname>PREFER_NATIVE</varname>.  If a package is specified
	in neither or in both variables, then
	<varname>PREFER_PKGSRC</varname> has precedence over
	<varname>PREFER_NATIVE</varname>.  For example, to require
	using pkgsrc versions of software for all but the most basic
      bits on a NetBSD system, you can set:</para>

<programlisting>
PREFER_PKGSRC=  yes
PREFER_NATIVE=  getopt skey tcp_wrappers
</programlisting>

      <para>A package <emphasis>must</emphasis> have a
      <filename>builtin.mk</filename>
      file to be listed in <varname>PREFER_NATIVE</varname>,
      otherwise it is simply ignored in that list.</para>

      <para><varname>PREFER_PKGSRC</varname> and
      <varname>PREFER_NATIVE</varname> should be set during bootstrap
      to ensure that the bootstrap process does not use inapropriate
      native tools as dependencies for core packages.

<screen>
&rprompt; <userinput>./bootstrap --prefer-pkgsrc yes --prefer-native openssl</userinput>
</screen>

      Switching between settings globally at a later date can introduce
      complications with dependency resolution. This is caused by packages
      built with the opposite preference being installed alongside each
      other.  Hence, any changes to these variables after bootstrap will
      necessitate rebuilding all packages depending on one whose preference
      has been changed.  This is not trivial and should be avoided.</para>

      <para>When using pkgsrc on Linux systems, there is high risk of
      "leakage", where programs installed by pkgsrc may inadvertently use a
      command or library not installed by pkgsrc, e.g. those installed by
      yum or apt.  Such foreign dependencies may be installed, removed, or
      upgraded to a version incompatible with the pkgsrc package at any
      time, causing pkgsrc packages to subsequently malfunction.  Pkgsrc
      cannot prevent this, as it has no control over other package managers.
      Another potential problem is that under Redhat Enterprise and related
      Linux systems, yum packages are only patched and never upgraded, so
      eventually they may become too outdated for use by pkgsrc.  Even
      intentionally using foreign dependencies, not considered leakage, can
      lead to these problems, so it is generally discouraged.  In order to
      minimize such problems, PREFER_PKGSRC defaults to "yes" on Linux systems.
      This ensures that pkgsrc is aware of any changes to dependency packages
      and can rebuild or upgrade the entire dependency tree as needed.  This
      default can be overridden by setting --prefer-pkgsrc to "no" or a list of
      packages, or by setting --prefer-native to "yes".</para>
