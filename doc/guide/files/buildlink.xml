  <title>Buildlink methodology</title>

  <para>Buildlink is a framework in pkgsrc that controls what headers and libraries
  are seen by a package's configure and build processes.  This is implemented
  in a two step process:</para>

  <orderedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>Symlink headers and libraries for dependencies into
      <varname>BUILDLINK_DIR</varname>, which by default is a subdirectory
      of <varname>WRKDIR</varname>.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>Create wrapper scripts that are used in place of the normal compiler
      tools that translate <option>-I${LOCALBASE}/include</option> and
      <option>-L${LOCALBASE}/lib</option> into references to
      <varname>BUILDLINK_DIR</varname>. The wrapper scripts also make
      native compiler on some operating systems look like GCC, so that
      packages that expect GCC won't require modifications to build with
      those native compilers.</para>
    </listitem>
  </orderedlist>

  <para>This normalizes the environment in which a package is built so that the
  package may be built consistently despite what other software may be
  installed. Please note that the normal system header and library paths,
  e.g. <filename>/usr/include</filename>,
  <filename>/usr/lib</filename>, etc., are always searched -- buildlink3 is
  designed to insulate the package build from non-system-supplied
  software.</para>

  <sect1 id="converting-to-buildlink3">
    <title>Converting packages to use buildlink3</title>

    <para>The process of converting packages to use the buildlink3
    framework (<quote>bl3ifying</quote>) is fairly straightforward.
    The things to keep in mind are:</para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>Ensure that the build always calls the wrapper scripts
	instead of the actual toolchain.  Some packages are tricky,
	and the only way to know for sure is the check
	<filename>${WRKDIR}/.work.log</filename> to see if the
	wrappers are being invoked.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Don't override <varname>PREFIX</varname> from within
	the package Makefile, e.g. Java VMs, standalone shells,
	etc., because the code to symlink files into
	<filename>${BUILDLINK_DIR}</filename> looks for files
	relative to <quote>pkg_info -qp <replaceable>pkgname</replaceable></quote>.
	</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Remember that <emphasis>only</emphasis> the
	<filename>buildlink3.mk</filename> files that you list in a
	package's Makefile are added as dependencies for that package.
	</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>

    <para>If a dependency on a particular package is required for its libraries and
    headers, then we replace:</para>

<programlisting>
DEPENDS+=       foo>=1.1.0:../../category/foo
</programlisting>

    <para>with</para>

<programlisting>
.include "../../category/foo/buildlink3.mk"
</programlisting>

    <para>The buildlink3.mk files usually define the required dependencies.
    If you need a newer version of the dependency when using buildlink3.mk
    files, then you can define it in your Makefile; for example:</para>

<programlisting>
BUILDLINK_API_DEPENDS.foo+=   foo>=1.1.0
.include "../../category/foo/buildlink3.mk"
</programlisting>

    <para>There are several <filename>buildlink3.mk</filename>
    files in <filename>pkgsrc/mk</filename>
    that handle special package issues:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para><filename>bdb.buildlink3.mk</filename> chooses either
	the native or a pkgsrc Berkeley DB implementation based on
	the values of <varname>BDB_ACCEPTED</varname> and
	<varname>BDB_DEFAULT</varname>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><filename>curses.buildlink3.mk</filename>: If the system
	comes with neither Curses nor NCurses, this will take care
	to install the <filename
	role="pkg">devel/ncurses</filename> package.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><filename>krb5.buildlink3.mk</filename> uses the value
	of <varname>KRB5_ACCEPTED</varname> to choose between
	adding a dependency on Heimdal or MIT-krb5 for packages that
	require a Kerberos 5 implementation.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><filename>motif.buildlink3.mk</filename> checks for a
	system-provided Motif installation or adds a dependency on
	<filename role="pkg">x11/lesstif</filename> or <filename
	role="pkg">x11/motif</filename>. The user can set
	<varname>MOTIF_TYPE</varname> to <quote>dt</quote>,
	<quote>lesstif</quote> or <quote>motif</quote>
	to choose which Motif version will be used.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><filename>readline.buildlink3.mk</filename> checks for a
	system-provided GNU readline or editline (libedit) installation,
	or adds a dependency on <filename role="pkg">devel/readline</filename>,
	<filename role="pkg">devel/editline</filename>. The user can set
	<varname>READLINE_DEFAULT</varname> to choose readline implementation.
	If your package really needs GNU readline library, its Makefile
	should include <filename>devel/readline/buildlink3.mk</filename>
	instead of <filename>readline.buildlink3.mk</filename>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><filename>oss.buildlink3.mk</filename> defines several
	variables that may be used by packages that use the
	Open Sound System (OSS) API.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><filename>pgsql.buildlink3.mk</filename> will accept
	any of the Postgres versions in the variable
	<varname>PGSQL_VERSIONS_ACCEPTED</varname> and default to

	the file for more information.</para>

      <listitem>
	<para><filename>pthread.buildlink3.mk</filename> uses the value of

    <para>A package's <filename>buildlink3.mk</filename> file is
    included by Makefiles to indicate the need to compile and link
    against header files and libraries provided by the package.  A
    <filename>buildlink3.mk</filename> file should always provide
    enough information to add the correct type of dependency
    relationship and include any other
    <filename>buildlink3.mk</filename> files that it needs to find
    headers and libraries that it needs in turn.</para>

    <para>To generate an initial <filename>buildlink3.mk</filename>
    file for further editing, Rene Hexel's <filename
    role="pkg">pkgtools/createbuildlink</filename>
    package is highly recommended.  For most packages, the following
    command will generate a good starting point for
    <filename>buildlink3.mk</filename> files:</para>

      <para>The main section is protected from multiple inclusion

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para><varname>BUILDLINK_API_DEPENDS.<replaceable>pkg</replaceable></varname>
	  is the dependency version recorded in the installed

	  package that had an backwards-incompatible API change.
	  </para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><varname>BUILDLINK_PKGSRCDIR.<replaceable>pkg</replaceable></varname>

	<listitem>
	  <para><varname>BUILDLINK_DEPMETHOD.<replaceable>pkg</replaceable></varname>
	  (not shown above) controls whether we use
	  <varname>BUILD_DEPENDS</varname> or

      <para>This section can additionally include any

      <replaceable>pkg</replaceable>'s library dependencies.
      Including these <filename>buildlink3.mk</filename> files
      means that the headers and libraries for these
      dependencies are also symlinked into
      <filename>${BUILDLINK_DIR}</filename>
      whenever the <replaceable>pkg</replaceable>
      <filename>buildlink3.mk</filename>
      file is included. Dependencies are only added for directly

      <para>When providing a <filename>buildlink3.mk</filename> and

      <para>In particular, if only an executable
      (<filename>bin/foo</filename>) is linked against a library, that
      library does not need to be propagated in the
      <filename>buildlink3.mk</filename> file.</para>

      <para>The following steps should help you decide if a

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para>Look at the installed header files: What
	headers do they include? The packages providing these files
	must be buildlinked.</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>Run <filename>ldd</filename> on all installed
	libraries and look against what other libraries they link.
	Some of the packages providing these probably need to be
	buildlinked; however, it's not automatic, since e.g. GTK on
	some systems pulls in the X libraries, so they will show up in
	the <filename>ldd</filename> output, while on others (like OS
	X) it won't. <filename>ldd</filename> output can thus only be
	used as a hint.</para></listitem>

      in <filename>buildlink3.mk</filename> files</title>

      <para>Both variables set lower bounds for a version of this package.
      The two variables differ in that one describes source
      compatibility (API) and the other binary compatibility (ABI).
      The difference is that a change in the API breaks compilation of
      programs while changes in the ABI stop compiled programs from
      running.</para>

      <para>The
      <varname>BUILDLINK_API_DEPENDS.<replaceable>pkg</replaceable></varname>
      variable in a <filename>buildlink3.mk</filename> should be
      changed very rarely.  (One possible scenario: If all packages
      using this package need a higher version than defined in the
      <filename>buildlink3.mk</filename>,
      <varname>BUILDLINK_API_DEPENDS.<replaceable>pkg</replaceable></varname>
      could be updated to that higher version.)</para>

      <para>On the other hand, changes to
      <varname>BUILDLINK_ABI_DEPENDS.<replaceable>pkg</replaceable></varname>
      are more common.  The variable will need to be updated every
      time the major version of one of its shared libraries is changed,
      or any other change where a binary built against the previous
      version of the package will not run against the new version any
      longer.</para>

      <para>In such a case, the package's
      <varname>BUILDLINK_ABI_DEPENDS.<replaceable>pkg</replaceable></varname>
      must be increased to require the new package version.  Then the
      <varname>PKGREVISION</varname> of all packages that depend on
      this package need to be increased, and if they have
      <filename>buildlink3.mk</filename> files, their
      <varname>BUILDLINK_ABI_DEPENDS.<replaceable>pkg</replaceable></varname>
      must be increased to the new version as well. This is required
      so that a package will pull in the versions of the packages that
      use the new ABI and that the packages'
      <varname>PKGREVISION</varname>s uniquely identify the packages
      built against the new ABI. The <filename
      role="pkg">pkgtools/revbump</filename> package can help with
      these updates.</para>

      <para>See <xref linkend="dependencies"/> for more information
      about dependencies on other packages, including the
      <varname>BUILDLINK_API_DEPENDS</varname> definitions.</para>

      <para>Please take careful consideration before adjusting

      cause unneeded package deletions and rebuilds.  In many cases,
      new versions of packages work just fine with older
      dependencies.</para>

      <para>Also it is not needed to set
      <varname>BUILDLINK_ABI_DEPENDS.<replaceable>pkg</replaceable></varname>

      <varname>CHECK_BUILTIN.<replaceable>pkg</replaceable></varname>,
      and includes code that uses the value of
      <varname>USE_BUILTIN.<replaceable>pkg</replaceable></varname>
      set in the previous section.  This typically includes, e.g.,
      adding additional dependency restrictions and listing additional
      files to symlink into <filename>${BUILDLINK_DIR}</filename> (via
      <varname>BUILDLINK_FILES.<replaceable>pkg</replaceable></varname>).</para>

      <title>Global preferences for native or pkgsrc software</title>

      <para>When building packages, it's possible to choose whether to set
	a global preference for using either the built-in (native)
	version or the pkgsrc version of software to satisfy a
	dependency.  This is controlled by setting
	<varname>PREFER_PKGSRC</varname> and
	<varname>PREFER_NATIVE</varname>.  These variables take values
	of either <quote>yes</quote>, <quote>no</quote>, or a list of
	packages.  <varname>PREFER_PKGSRC</varname> tells pkgsrc to
	use the pkgsrc versions of software, while
	<varname>PREFER_NATIVE</varname> tells pkgsrc to use the
	built-in versions.  Preferences are determined by the most
	specific instance of the package in either
	<varname>PREFER_PKGSRC</varname> or
	<varname>PREFER_NATIVE</varname>.  If a package is specified
	in neither or in both variables, then
	<varname>PREFER_PKGSRC</varname> has precedence over
	<varname>PREFER_NATIVE</varname>.  For example, to require
	using pkgsrc versions of software for all but the most basic
      bits on a NetBSD system, you can set:</para>

<programlisting>
PREFER_PKGSRC=  yes
PREFER_NATIVE=  getopt skey tcp_wrappers
</programlisting>

      <para>A package <emphasis>must</emphasis> have a
      <filename>builtin.mk</filename>
      file to be listed in <varname>PREFER_NATIVE</varname>,
      otherwise it is simply ignored in that list.</para>

      <para>Setting <varname>PREFER_NATIVE</varname> should be performed
      straight after bootstrap and <varname>PREFER_PKGSRC</varname> during
      bootstrap.
      Switching between settings globally at a later date can introduce
      complications with dependency resolution. This is caused by packages
      built with the opposite preference being installed alongside each other.</para>
