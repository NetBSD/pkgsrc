  <title>Package components - files, directories and contents</title>
  
  <para>  Whenever you're preparing a package, there are a number of
    files involved which are described in the following
    sections. </para> 

  <sect1 id="components.Makefile">
    <title><filename>Makefile</filename></title>

    <para>Building, installation and creation of a binary package are all
      controlled by the package's <filename>Makefile</filename>.</para>

    <para>There is a <filename>Makefile</filename> for each package.
      This file includes the standard
      <filename>bsd.pkg.mk</filename> file (referenced as
      <filename>../../mk/bsd.pkg.mk</filename>), which sets all the
      definitions and actions necessary for the package to compile and
      install itself. The mandatory variables are the
      <varname>DISTNAME</varname> which specifies the base name
      of the distribution file to be downloaded from the site on the
      Internet, <varname>MASTER_SITES</varname> which specifies that site,
      <varname>CATEGORIES</varname> which denotes the
      categories into which the package falls, <varname>PKGNAME</varname>
      which is the name of the package, the <varname>MAINTAINER</varname>'s
      name, and the <varname>COMMENT</varname> variable, which should
      contain a one-line description of the package (the package name
      should not appear, it will be added automatically). The maintainer
      variable is there so that anyone who quibbles with the (always
      completely correct) decisions taken by the guy who maintains the
      package can complain vigorously, or send chocolate as a sign of
      appreciation.</para>

    <para>The <varname>MASTER_SITES</varname> may be set to one of the
      predefined sites:</para>

    <programlisting>
        ${MASTER_SITE_APACHE}
        ${MASTER_SITE_DEBIAN}
        ${MASTER_SITE_GNOME}
        ${MASTER_SITE_GNU}
        ${MASTER_SITE_GNUSTEP}
        ${MASTER_SITE_MOZILLA}
        ${MASTER_SITE_PERL_CPAN}
        ${MASTER_SITE_SOURCEFORGE}
        ${MASTER_SITE_SUNSITE}
        ${MASTER_SITE_R_CRAN}
        ${MASTER_SITE_SUSE}
        ${MASTER_SITE_TEX_CTAN}
        ${MASTER_SITE_XCONTRIB}
        ${MASTER_SITE_XEMACS} </programlisting>

    <para>If one of these predefined sites is chosen, you may require the
      ability to specify a subdirectory of that site.  Since these macros
      may expand to more than one actual site, you
      <emphasis>must</emphasis> use the following construct to specify a
      subdirectory:</para>

    <programlisting>
        ${MASTER_SITE_GNU:=subdirectory/name/}
        ${MASTER_SITE_SOURCEFORGE:=project_name/} </programlisting>

    <para>Note the trailing slash after the subdirectory name.</para>

    <note>
      <para><varname>MASTER_SITE_SUBDIR</varname> has been deprecated and
        <emphasis>should no longer be used</emphasis>.</para>
    </note>

    <para>If the package has multiple <varname>DISTFILES</varname> or multiple
      <varname>PATCHFILES</varname> from different
      sites, set <varname>SITES_foo</varname> to a list of URI's where file
      <quote>foo</quote> may be found. <quote>foo</quote>
      includes the suffix, e.g.</para>

<programlisting>DISTFILES=      ${DISTNAME}${EXTRACT_SUFX}
DISTFILES+=     foo-file.tar.gz
SITES_foo-file.tar.gz=http://www.somewhere.com/somehow/ \
        http://www.somewhereelse.com/mirror/somehow/</programlisting>

    <para>Note that the normal default setting of <varname>DISTFILES</varname>
      must be made explicit if you want to add to it (rather than replace
      it), as you usually would.</para>

    <para>Currently the following values are available for
      <varname>CATEGORIES</varname>. If more than
      one is used, they need to be separated by spaces:</para>

    <programlisting>
archivers     cross         geography     meta-pkgs     security
audio         databases     graphics      misc          shells
benchmarks    devel         ham           multimedia    sysutils
biology       editors       inputmethod   net           textproc
cad           emulators     lang          news          time
chat          finance       mail          parallel      wm
comms         fonts         math          pkgtools      www
converters    games         mbone         print         x11</programlisting>

    <para> Please pay attention to the following gotchas: </para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Add <varname>MANCOMPRESSED</varname> if manpages are installed in
          compressed form by the package; see comment in
          <filename>bsd.pkg.mk</filename>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Replace <filename>/usr/local</filename> with
          <quote>${PREFIX}</quote> in all files (see patches, below).</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>If the package installs any info files, see
          <xref linkend="faq.info-files"/>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Set <varname>MAINTAINER</varname> to be yourself. 
          If you really can't maintain the package for future updates,
          set it to <email>tech-pkg@NetBSD.org</email>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>If a home page for the software in question exists, 
          add the variable <varname>HOMEPAGE</varname> right after
          <varname>MAINTAINER</varname>. The value of this
          variable should be the URL for the home page.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Be sure to set the <varname>COMMENT</varname> variable to a short
          description of the package, not containing the pkg's name.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="components.distinfo">
    <title><filename>distinfo</filename></title>

    <para>Most important, the mandatory message digest, or checksum, of all the
      distfiles needed for the package to compile, confirming they match the
      original file distributed by the author.  This ensures that the
      distfile retrieved from the Internet has not been corrupted during
      transfer or altered by a malign force to introduce a security hole.
      It is generated using the <command>make makesum</command> command.
      The digest algorithm used was, at one stage, md5, but that was felt
      lacking compared to sha1, and so sha1 is now the default algorithm.
      The distfile size is also generated and stored in new distinfo files.
      The <pkg>pkgtools/digest</pkg> utility calculates all of the digests
      in the distinfo file, and it provides various different algorithms.
      At the current time, the algorithms provided are:
      <emphasis>md5</emphasis>, <emphasis>rmd160</emphasis>,
      <emphasis>sha1</emphasis>, <emphasis>sha256</emphasis>,
      <emphasis>sha384</emphasis> and <emphasis>sha512</emphasis>.</para>

    <para>Some packages have different sets of distfiles on a per architecture
      basis, for example <pkg>www/navigator</pkg>). These are kept in the
      same distinfo file and care should be taken when upgrading such a
      package to ensure distfile information is not lost.</para>

    <para>The message digest/checksum for all the official patches found in the
      <filename>patches/</filename> directory (see
      <xref linkend="components.patches"/>) for the package is also stored in
      the <filename>distinfo</filename> file. This is a message
      digest/checksum of all lines in the patch file except the &os; RCS Id.
      This file is generated by invoking <command>make
      makepatchsum</command> (or <command>make mps</command> if you're
      in a hurry).</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="components.patches">
    <title>patches/*</title>

    <para>This directory contains files that are used by the
      &man.patch.1; command to
      modify the sources as distributed in the distribution file into a form
      that will compile and run perfectly on &os;. The files are applied
      successively in alphabetic order (as returned by a shell
      <quote>patches/patch-*</quote> glob expansion), so
      <filename>patch-aa</filename> is applied before
      <filename>patch-ab</filename>, etc.</para>

    <para> Patch files which are optional and will depend on local
      site configuration can be included with names matching the
      pattern <filename>patches/patch-optional-*</filename>. Their
      suffixes should match the configuration options.  The selected
      optional patch file names should be assigned to the variable
      <varname>OPTIONAL_PATCHFILES</varname>.  They will not be
      applied by default. 
      </para>

    <para> For example if a package data file needs patching to
      indicate the default local printer paper size as specified in
      the <varname>$PAPERSIZE</varname> file you can include patches
      for all the possible paper sizes other than the one the package
      comes configured for by default.  In this case you might have a
      patch called
      "<filename>patch-optional-Letter-papersize</filename>" and/or
      another patch called
      "<filename>patch-optional-A4-papersize</filename>".  In your
      <filename>Makefile</filename> you would select between them with
      the following construct:
      </para>

    <programlisting>            
   PATCHDIR=    ${.CURDIR}/patches
   .if exists(${PATCHDIR}/patch-optional-${PAPERSIZE}-papersize)
        OPTIONAL_PATCHFILES+= ${PATCHDIR}/patch-optional-${PAPERSIZE}-papersize
   .endif </programlisting>

    <para> Note that you have to define the value of
      <varname>PATCHDIR</varname> in order to use it in a
      <quote><command>.if</command></quote> statement like this as
      otherwise it's not defined until too late during the processing
      of the Makefile.  You should use a
      <quote><command>.if</command></quote> statement in order to
      avoid problems should the configuration item
      (<varname>$PAPERSIZE</varname> in this example) be set to an
      unexpected value.
      </para>
      
    <para>The <filename>patch-*</filename> files should be in
      <command>diff -bu</command> format, and apply without a fuzz to avoid
      problems. (To force patches to apply
      with fuzz you can set <varname>PATCH_FUZZ_FACTOR=-F2</varname>).
      Furthermore, do not put changes for more than one file into a single
      patch-file, as this will make future modifications more difficult.</para>

    <para>Similar, a file should be patched at most once, not several times by
      several different patches. If a file needs several patches, they should
      be combined into one file.</para>

    <para>One important thing to mention is to pay attention that no RCS IDs
      get stored in the patch files, as these will cause problems when
      later checked into the &os; CVS tree. Use the
      <command>pkgdiff</command> from the 
      <pkg>pkgtools/pkgdiff</pkg> package to avoid these problems.</para>

    <para>For even more automation, we recommend using <command>mkpatches</command> from the same
      package to make a whole set of patches. You just have to backup files
      before you edit them to <filename>filename.orig</filename>, e.g. with
      <command>cp -p filename filename.orig</command> or, easier, by using
      <command>pkgvi</command> again from the same package. If you upgrade a package
      this way, you can easily compare the new set of patches with the
      previously existing one with <command>patchdiff</command>.</para>

    <para>When you have finished a package, remember to generate the checksums
      for the patch files by using the <command>make makepatchsum</command>
      command, see <xref linkend="components.distinfo"/>.</para>

    <para>Patch files that are distributed by the author or other
      maintainers can be listed in
      <varname>$PATCHFILES</varname>. </para> 
    
    <para>If it is desired to store any patches that should not be committed into
      pkgsrc, they can be kept outside the pkgsrc tree in the
      <filename>$LOCALPATCHES</filename>
      directory. The directory tree there is expected to have the same
      <quote>category/package</quote> structure as pkgsrc, and patches are
      expected to be stored inside these dirs (also known as
      <filename>$LOCALPATCHES/$PKGPATH</filename>). For
      example if you want to keep a private patch for
      <filename>pkgsrc/graphics/png</filename>, keep
      it in <filename>$LOCALPATCHES/graphics/png/mypatch</filename>. All
      files in the named directory are expected to be patch files, and
      <emphasis>they are applied after pkgsrc patches are applied</emphasis>.</para>

            this script's responsibility to clean up any additional messy details

    <title><filename>work*</filename></title>

    <para>When you type <command>make</command> the distribution files are
      unpacked into this directory. It can be removed by running
      <command>make clean</command>. Besides the sources, this
      directory is also used to keep various timestamp files.</para>
      
    <para> If a package doesn't create a subdirectory for itself (like
      GNU software   does, for instance), but extracts itself in the
      current directory,   you should set <varname>WRKSRC</varname>
      accordingly, e.g.   <pkg>editors/sam</pkg> again, but the quick
      answer is: </para>

    <programlisting>WRKSRC=		${WRKDIR}</programlisting>

    <para> Please note that the old <varname>NO_WRKSUBDIR</varname>
      has been deprecated and should not be used. Also, if your
      package doesn't create a subdir with the name of
      <varname>DISTNAME</varname> but some different name, set
      <varname>WRKSRC</varname> to point to the proper name in
      <filename>${WRKDIR}</filename>. See <pkg>lang/tcl</pkg> and
      <pkg>x11/tk</pkg> for examples, and here is another one: </para>
      
    <programlisting>WRKSRC=         ${WRKDIR}/${DISTNAME}/unix</programlisting>

    <para> The name of the working directory created by pkgsrc is
      <filename>work</filename> by default. If the same pkgsrc tree
      should be used on several different platforms, the variable
      <varname>OBJMACHINE</varname> can be set in /etc/mk.conf to
      attach the platform to the directory name,
      e.g. <filename>work.i386</filename> or
      <filename>work.sparc</filename>. </para>

  <sect1>
    <title><filename>files/*</filename></title>

    <para>If you have any files that you wish to be placed in the package prior
      to configuration or building, you could place these files here and use
      a <quote>${CP}</quote> command in the
      <quote>pre-configure</quote> target to achieve 
      this. Alternatively, you could simply diff the file against
      <filename>/dev/null</filename> and use the patch mechanism to manage
      the creation of this file.</para>
