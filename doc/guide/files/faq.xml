  <title>Frequently Asked Questions</title>

  <para> This section contains hints, tips &amp; tricks on special
    things in pkgsrc that we didn't find a better place for in the
    previous chapters, and it contains items for both pkgsrc users and
    developers. </para>

    <title>How to use pkgsrc as non-root</title>
    
     <para>  If you want to use pkgsrc as non-root user, you can set
      some variables  to make pkgsrc work under these
      conditions. Please see   <ulink
      url="http://mail-index.NetBSD.org/tech-pkg/2003/09/27/0023.html">this
      message</ulink> for more details.  </para>

<sect1>
    <title>How to resume transfers when fetching distfiles?</title>

    <para>By default resuming transfers in pkgsrc is disabled, but you
	can enable this feature by adding the option 
	<varname>PKG_RESUME_TRANSFERS=YES</varname> into 
	<filename>/etc/mk.conf</filename>. If, during a fetch step, an
	incomplete distfile is found, pkgsrc will try to resume it.</para>
    <para>You can also use a different program than the default &man.ftp.1; by
	changing the <varname>FETCH_CMD</varname> variable.
	Don't forget to set <varname>FETCH_RESUME_ARGS</varname> and
	<varname>FETCH_OUTPUT_ARGS</varname> if you are not using default
	values.</para>
    <para>For example, if you want to use <filename>wget</filename> to
	resume downloads, you'll have to use something like:</para>

    <programlisting>
        FETCH_CMD=wget
        .if defined(FETCH_CMD) &amp;&amp; ${FETCH_CMD} == "wget"
        FETCH_BEFORE_ARGS=--passive-ftp
        FETCH_RESUME_ARGS=-c
        FETCH_OUTPUT_ARGS=-O
        .endif
    </programlisting>

    <title>How can I install/use XFree86 from pkgsrc?</title>

    <para> If you want to use XFree86 from pkgsrc instead of your
      system's own X11 (<filename>/usr/X11R6</filename>,
      <filename>/usr/openwin</filename>, ...), you will have to 
      add the following line into <filename>/etc/mk.conf</filename>:
      </para>

    <programlisting>
      X11_TYPE=XFree86
    </programlisting>
</sect1>


<sect1>
    <title>How can I install/use X.org from pkgsrc?</title>

    <para> If you want to use X.org from pkgsrc instead of your system's
      own X11 (<filename>/usr/X11R6</filename>,
      <filename>/usr/openwin</filename>, ...) you will have to add the
      following line into <filename>/etc/mk.conf</filename>: </para>

    <programlisting>
      X11_TYPE=xorg

    <title>How to fetch files from behind a firewall</title>

    <para> If you are sitting behind a firewall which does not allow
      direct connections to Internet hosts (i.e. non-NAT), you may
      specify the relevant proxy hosts. This is done using an
      environment variable in the form of a URL e.g. in Amdahl, the
      machine <quote>orpheus.amdahl.com</quote> is one of the
      firewalls, and it uses port 80 as the proxy port number. So the
      proxy environment variables are: </para>

    <programlisting>  ftp_proxy=ftp://orpheus.amdahl.com:80/
http_proxy=http://orpheus.amdahl.com:80/</programlisting>
</sect1>

    
<sect1>
    <title>How do I tell <command>make fetch</command> to do passive FTP?</title>

    <para> This depends on which utility is used to retrieve distfiles. From <filename>bsd.pkg.mk</filename>, <varname>FETCH_CMD</varname> is assigned the first available command from the following list: </para>

    <programlisting>${LOCALBASE}/bin/ftp
/usr/bin/ftp</programlisting>

    <para> On a default NetBSD installation, this will be
      <filename>/usr/bin/ftp</filename>, which automatically tries
      passive connections first, and falls back to active connections
      if the server refuses to do passive. For the other tools, add
      the following to your <filename>/etc/mk.conf</filename> file:
      <varname>PASSIVE_FETCH=1</varname>. </para> 

    <para> Having that option present will prevent
      <filename>/usr/bin/ftp</filename> from falling back to active
      transfers. </para>
</sect1>

    
<sect1>
    <title>How to fetch all distfiles at once</title>

    <para> You would like to download all the distfiles in a single
      batch from work or university, where you can't run a
      <command>make fetch</command>. There is an archive of distfiles
      on <ulink
      url="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/packages/distfiles/">ftp.NetBSD.org</ulink>,
      but downloading the entire directory may not be appropriate.
      </para>

    <para> The answer here is to do a <command>make
      fetch-list</command> in <filename>/usr/pkgsrc</filename> or one
      of it's subdirectories, carry the resulting list to your machine
      at work/school and use it there. If you don't have a
      NetBSD-compatible &man.ftp.1; (like lukemftp) at work, don't forget
      to set <varname>FETCH_CMD</varname> to something that fetches a
      URL: </para>

    <para> At home: </para>

    <screen><prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>cd /usr/pkgsrc</userinput>
<prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>make fetch-list FETCH_CMD=wget DISTDIR=/tmp/distfiles >/tmp/fetch.sh</userinput>
<prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>scp /tmp/fetch.sh work:/tmp</userinput></screen>

    <para> At work: </para>

    <screen><prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>sh /tmp/fetch.sh</userinput></screen>

    <para> then tar up <filename>/tmp/distfiles</filename> and take it
      home. </para>

    <para> If you have a machine running NetBSD, and you want to get
      <emphasis>all</emphasis> distfiles (even ones that aren't for
      your machine architecture), you can do so by using the
      above-mentioned <command>make fetch-list</command> approach, or
      fetch the distfiles directly by running: </para>

    <screen><prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>make mirror-distfiles</userinput></screen>

    <para> If you even decide to ignore
      <varname>NO_{SRC,BIN}_ON_{FTP,CDROM}</varname>, then you can get
      everything by running: </para>

    <screen><prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>make fetch NO_SKIP=yes</userinput></screen>
</sect1>


<sect1>
    <title>What does <quote>Don't know how to make /usr/share/tmac/tmac.andoc</quote> mean?</title>

    <para> When compiling the <pkg>pkgtools/pkg_install</pkg> package,
      you get the error from make that it doesn't know how to make
      <filename>/usr/share/tmac/tmac.andoc</filename>? This indicates
      that you don't have installed the <quote>text</quote> set
      (nroff, ...) from the NetBSD base distribution on
      your machine. It is recommended to do that to
      format manpages.  </para>

    <para> In the case of the <pkg>pkgtools/pkg_install</pkg> package,
      you can get away with setting <varname>NOMAN=YES</varname>
      either in the environment or in
      <filename>/etc/mk.conf</filename>.  </para>
</sect1>


<sect1>
    <title>What does <quote>Could not find bsd.own.mk</quote> mean?</title>

    <para> You didn't install the compiler set,
      <filename>comp.tgz</filename>, when you installed your NetBSD
      machine. Please get it and install it, by extracting it in
      <filename>/</filename>: </para>

    <screen><prompt>#</prompt> <userinput>cd /</userinput>
<prompt>#</prompt> <userinput>tar --unlink -zxvpf .../comp.tgz</userinput></screen>

    <para> <filename>comp.tgz</filename> is part of every NetBSD
      release. Get the one that corresponds to your release (determine
      via <command>uname -r</command>).  </para>

    <title>Using 'sudo' with pkgsrc</title>

    <para>
      When installing packages as non-root user and using the
      just-in-time &man.su.1; feature of pkgsrc, it can become annoying to
      type in the root password for each required package
      installed. To avoid this, the sudo package can be used, which
      does password caching over a limited time.  To use it, install
      sudo (either as binary package or from <pkg>security/sudo</pkg>)
      and then put the following into your
      <filename>/etc/mk.conf</filename>: </para>

    <programlisting>
        .if exists(${LOCALBASE}/bin/sudo)
        SU_CMD=${LOCALBASE}/bin/sudo /bin/sh -c
        .endif
    </programlisting>

<sect1 id="faq.conf">
    <title>Configuration files handling and placement</title>

    <para>  The global variable <varname>PKG_SYSCONFBASE</varname>
      (and some others)  can be set by the system administrator in
      <filename>/etc/mk.conf</filename>  to define the place where
      configuration files get installed. Therefore, packages must be
      adapted to  support this feature. Keep in mind that you should
      only install files that  are strictly necessary in the
      configuration directory, files that can  go to
      <filename>$PREFIX/share</filename> should go there.  </para> 

    <para> We will take a look at available variables first
      (<filename>bsd.pkg.mk</filename> contains more
      information). <varname>PKG_SYSCONFDIR</varname> is where the
      configuration files for a package may be found (that is, the
      full path, e.g. <filename>/etc</filename> or
      <filename>/usr/pkg/etc</filename>). This value may be customized
      in various ways: </para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para> <varname>PKG_SYSCONFBASE</varname> is the main config
          directory under which all package configuration files are to
          be found. Users will typically want to set it to
          <filename>/etc</filename>, or accept the default location of
          <filename>$PREFIX/etc</filename>.  </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para> <varname>PKG_SYSCONFSUBDIR</varname> is the
          subdirectory of <varname>PKG_SYSCONFBASE</varname> under
          which the configuration files for a particular package may
          be found. Defaults to <varname>${SYSCONFBASE}</varname>.
          </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>      <varname>PKG_SYSCONFVAR</varname> is the special
          suffix used to      distinguish any overriding values for a
          particular package      (see next item). It defaults to
          <varname>${PKGBASE}</varname>, but      for a collection of
          related packages that should all have the same
          <varname>PKG_SYSCONFDIR</varname> value, it can be set in
          each of      the package Makefiles to a common value.
          </para> 
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>
          <varname>PKG_SYSCONFDIR.${PKG_SYSCONFVAR}</varname>
          overrides the value of
          <varname>${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}</varname> for packages with the
          same value      for <varname>PKG_SYSCONFVAR</varname>.
          </para> 

        <para> As an example, all the various KDE packages may want to
          set <varname>PKG_SYSCONFVAR</varname> to <quote>kde</quote>
          so admins can set <varname>PKG_SYSCONFDIR.kde</varname> in
          <filename>/etc/mk.conf</filename> to define where to install
          KDE config files.  </para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>

    <para> Programs' configuration directory should be defined during
          the configure stage. Packages that use GNU autoconf can
          usually do this by using the <quote>--sysconfdir</quote>
          parameter, but this brings some problems as we will see now.
          When you change this pathname in packages, you should not
          allow them to install files in that directory
          directly. Instead they need to install those files under
          <filename>share/examples/${PKGNAME}</filename> so
          <filename>PLIST</filename> can register them.  </para>

    <para> Once you have the required configuration files in place
      (under the <filename>share/examples</filename> directory) the
      variable <varname>CONF_FILES</varname> should be set to copy
      them into <varname>PKG_SYSCONFDIR</varname>. The contents of
      this variable is formed by pairs of filenames; the first element
      of the pair specifies the file inside the examples directory
      (registered by <filename>PLIST</filename>) and the second
      element specifies the target file. This is done this way to
      allow binary packages to place files in the right directory
      using
      <filename>INSTALL</filename>/<filename>DEINSTALL</filename>
      scripts which are created automatically.  The package
      <filename>Makefile</filename> must also set
      <varname>USE_PKGINSTALL=YES</varname> to use these automatically
      generated scripts.  The automatic copying of config files can be
      toggled by setting the environment variable
      <varname>PKG_CONFIG</varname> prior to package installation.
      </para>

    <para> Here is an example, taken from mail/mutt/Makefile: </para>

    <programlisting>  EGDIR=            ${PREFIX}/share/doc/mutt/samples
CONF_FILES=   ${EGDIR}/Muttrc ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/Muttrc</programlisting>

    <para>  As you can see, this package installs configuration files
      inside  <varname>EGDIR</varname>, which are registered by
      <filename>PLIST</filename>. After that, the variable
      <varname>CONF_FILES</varname> lists  the installed file first
      and then the target file. Users will also get an  automatic
      message when files are installed using this method. </para>

    <title>Automated security checks</title>

    <para> Please be aware that there can often be bugs in third-party
      software, and some of these bugs can leave a machine vulnerable
      to exploitation by attackers.  In an effort to lessen the
      exposure, the NetBSD packages team maintains a database of
      known-exploits to packages which have at one time been included
      in pkgsrc.  The database can be downloaded automatically, and a
      security audit of all packages installed on a system can take
      place.  To do this, install the
      <pkg>security/audit-packages</pkg> package.  It has two
      components: </para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para> <quote>download-vulnerability-list</quote>, an easy way
          to download a list of the security vulnerabilities
          information. This list is kept up to date by the NetBSD
          security officer and the NetBSD packages team, and is
          distributed from the NetBSD ftp server: </para>

        <para> <ulink
          url="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/packages/distfiles/pkg-vulnerabilities"/>
          </para>  
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para> <quote>audit-packages</quote>, an easy way to audit the
          current machine, checking each vulnerability which is
          known. If a vulnerable package is installed, it will
          be shown by output to stdout, including a description
          of the type of vulnerability, and a URL containing more
          information.  </para> 
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>

    <para> Use of the <pkg>security/audit-packages</pkg> package is
        strongly recommended!
        After <quote>audit-packages</quote> is installed, please read
        the package's message, which you can get by running
        <userinput>pkg_info -D audit-package</userinput>.
