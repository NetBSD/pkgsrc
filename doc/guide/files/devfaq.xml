<title>Frequently Asked Questions</title>

	<para>This section contains the answers to questions that may
	arise when you are writing a package. If you don't find your
	question answered here, first have a look in the other chapters,
	and if you still don't have the answer, ask on the
	<literal>pkgsrc-users</literal> mailing list.</para>

<qandaset>
<qandaentry id="devfaq.makeflags">

	<question><para>What is the difference between
	<varname>MAKEFLAGS</varname>, <varname>.MAKEFLAGS</varname> and
	<varname>MAKE_FLAGS</varname>?</para></question>

	<answer><para><varname>MAKEFLAGS</varname> are the flags passed
	to the pkgsrc-internal invocations of &man.make.1;, while
	<varname>MAKE_FLAGS</varname> are the flags that are passed to
	the <varname>MAKE_PROGRAM</varname> when building the
	package. [FIXME: What is .MAKEFLAGS for?]</para></answer>

<qandaentry id="devfaq.make">

	<question><para>What is the difference between
	<varname>MAKE</varname>, <varname>GMAKE</varname> and
	<varname>MAKE_PROGRAM</varname>?</para></question>

	<answer><para><varname>MAKE</varname> is the path to the
	&man.make.1; program that is used in the pkgsrc
	infrastructure. <varname>GMAKE</varname> is the path to GNU
	Make, but you need to say <varname>USE_TOOLS+=gmake</varname> to
	use that. <varname>MAKE_PROGRAM</varname> is the path to the
	Make program that is used for building the
	package.</para></answer>

<qandaentry id="devfaq.cc">

	<question><para>What is the difference between
	<varname>CC</varname>, <varname>PKG_CC</varname> and
	<varname>PKGSRC_COMPILER</varname>?</para></question>

	<answer><para><varname>CC</varname> is the path to the real C
	compiler, which can be configured by the pkgsrc user.
	<varname>PKG_CC</varname> is the path to the compiler wrapper.
	<varname>PKGSRC_COMPILER</varname> is <emphasis>not</emphasis> a
	path to a compiler, but the type of compiler that should be
	used. See <filename>mk/compiler.mk</filename> for more
	information about the latter variable.</para></answer>

<qandaentry id="devfaq.bl3flags">

	<question><para>What is the difference between
	<varname>BUILDLINK_LDFLAGS</varname>,
	<varname>BUILDLINK_LDADD</varname> and
	<varname>BUILDLINK_LIBS</varname>?</para></question>

	<answer><para>[FIXME]</para></answer>

</qandaentry>
<qandaentry id="devfaq.bl3prefix">

	<question><para>Why does <command>make show-var
	VARNAME=BUILDLINK_PREFIX.<replaceable>foo</replaceable></command>
	say it's empty?</para></question>

	<answer><para>For optimization reasons, some variables are only
	available in the <quote>wrapper</quote> phase and later. To
	<quote>simulate</quote> the wrapper phase, append
	<command>PKG_PHASE=wrapper</command> to the above
	command.</para></answer>

</qandaentry>
<qandaentry id="devfaq.master_sites">

	<question><para>What does
	<code>${MASTER_SITE_SOURCEFORGE:=package/}</code> mean? I
	don't understand the <code>:=</code> inside
	it.</para></question>

	<answer><para>The <code>:=</code> is not really an
	assignment operator, although it looks like it.
	Instead, it is a degenerate form of
	<code>${LIST:<replaceable>old_string</replaceable>=<replaceable>new_string</replaceable>}</code>,
	which is documented in the &man.make.1; man page and which is
	commonly used in the form <code>${SRCS:.c=.o}</code>. In the
	case of <varname>MASTER_SITE_*</varname>,
	<replaceable>old_string</replaceable> is the empty string and
	<replaceable>new_string</replaceable> is
	<code>package/</code>. That's where the
	<code>:</code> and the <code>=</code> fall
	together.</para></answer>

<qandaentry id="devfaq.mailinglists">

	<question><para>Which mailing lists are there for package
	developers?</para></question>

	<answer><variablelist>

	<varlistentry><term><ulink
	url="http://www.NetBSD.org/mailinglists/index.html#tech-pkg">tech-pkg</ulink></term>

	<listitem><para>This is a list for technical discussions related
	to pkgsrc development, e.g. soliciting feedback for changes to
	pkgsrc infrastructure, proposed new features, questions related
	to porting pkgsrc to a new platform, advice for maintaining a
	package, patches that affect many packages, help requests moved
	from pkgsrc-users when an infrastructure bug is found,
	etc.</para></listitem></varlistentry>

	<varlistentry><term><ulink

	<listitem><para>All bug reports in category "pkg" sent with

	directly; use one of the other mailing
	lists.</para></listitem></varlistentry>

<qandaentry id="devfaq.documentation">

	<question><para>Where is the pkgsrc
	documentation?</para></question>

	<answer><para>There are many places where you can find
	documentation about pkgsrc:</para>

	<itemizedlist>

	<listitem><para>The pkgsrc guide (this document) is a collection
	of chapters that explain large parts of pkgsrc, but some
	chapters tend to be outdated. Which ones they are is hard to
	say.</para></listitem>

	<listitem><para>On the mailing list archives (see <ulink
	url="http://mail-index.NetBSD.org/"/>), you can find discussions
	about certain features, announcements of new parts of the pkgsrc
	infrastructure and sometimes even announcements that a certain
	feature has been marked as obsolete. The benefit here is that
	each message has a date appended to it.</para></listitem>

	<listitem><para>Many of the files in the
	<filename>mk/</filename> directory start with a comment that
	describes the purpose of the file and how it can be used by the
	pkgsrc user and package authors. An easy way to find this
	documentation is to run <command>bmake
	help</command>.</para></listitem>

	<listitem><para>The CVS log messages are a rich source of
	information, but they tend to be highly abbreviated, especially
	for actions that occur often. Some contain a detailed
	description of what has changed, but they are geared towards the
	other pkgsrc developers, not towards an average pkgsrc user.
	They also only document <emphasis>changes</emphasis>, so if you
	don't know what has been before, these messages may not be worth
	too much to you.</para></listitem>

	<listitem><para>Some parts of pkgsrc are only <quote>implicitly
	documented</quote>, that is the documentation exists only in the
	mind of the developer who wrote the code. To get this
	information, use the <command>cvs annotate</command> command
	to see who has written it and ask on the
	<literal>tech-pkg</literal> mailing list, so that others can
	find your questions later (see above). To be sure that the
	developer in charge reads the mail, you may CC him or
	her.</para></listitem>

<qandaentry id="devfaq.too-much-time">
<question><para>I have a little time to kill.  What shall I
do?</para></question>

<answer><para>This is not really an FAQ yet, but here's the answer
anyway.</para>

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem><para>Run <command>pkg_chk -N</command> (from the
    <filename role="pkg">pkgtools/pkg_chk</filename> package).  It
    will tell you about newer versions of installed packages that are
    available, but not yet updated in pkgsrc.</para></listitem>

    <listitem><para>Browse <filename>pkgsrc/doc/TODO</filename>
    &mdash; it contains a list of suggested new packages and a list of
    cleanups and enhancements for pkgsrc that would be nice to
    have.</para></listitem>

    <listitem><para>Review packages for which review was requested on
    the <ulink url="http://www.NetBSD.org/mailinglists/index.html#tech-pkg">tech-pkg</ulink>
