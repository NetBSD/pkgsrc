    <para>Installing the bootstrap kit from source should be as simple as:</para>

    <screen>
&rprompt; <userinput>env CVS_RSH=ssh cvs -d anoncvs@anoncvs.NetBSD.org:/cvsroot checkout pkgsrc</userinput>
&rprompt; <userinput>cd pkgsrc/bootstrap</userinput>
&rprompt; <userinput>./bootstrap</userinput>
    </screen>

    <para>See <xref linkend="getting"/> for other ways to get
    pkgsrc before bootstrapping. The given
    <command>bootstrap</command> command will use the defaults of
    <filename>/usr/pkg</filename> for the
    <emphasis>prefix</emphasis> where programs will be installed in,
    and <filename>/var/db/pkg</filename> for the package database
    directory where pkgsrc will do its internal bookkeeping.
    However, these can also be set using command-line
    arguments.</para>

    <note>
      <para>The bootstrap installs a <command>bmake</command> tool.
      Use this <command>bmake</command> when building via pkgsrc.
      For examples in this guide, use <command>bmake</command>

    <sect2 id="interix">
      <title>Interix</title>

      <para>Interix is a POSIX-compatible subsystem for the Windows NT kernel,
      providing a Unix-like environment with a tighter kernel integration than
      available with Cygwin.  It is part of the Windows Services for Unix
      package, available for free for any licensed copy of Windows 2000, XP
      (not including XP Home), or 2003.  SFU can be downloaded from <ulink
      url="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/sfu/">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/sfu/</ulink>.</para>

      <para>Services for Unix 3.5 has been tested.  3.0 or 3.1 may work, but
      are not officially supported.  (The main difference in 3.0/3.1 is lack
      of pthreads, but other parts of libc may also be lacking.)</para>

      <para>Services for Unix Applications (aka SUA) is an integrated component
      of Windows Server 2003 R2 and Windows Vista.  As of this writing, SUA's
      Interix 5.x subsystem has not yet been tested with pkgsrc.</para>

      <sect3 id="platform.interix-sfu-install">
	<title>When installing Interix/SFU</title>

	<para>At an absolute minimum, the following packages must be installed from
	the Windows Services for Unix 3.5 distribution in order to use pkgsrc:</para>

	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem><para>Utilities -&gt; Base Utilities</para></listitem>
	  <listitem><para>Interix GNU Components -&gt; (all)</para></listitem>
	  <listitem><para>Remote Connectivity</para></listitem>
	  <listitem><para>Interix SDK</para></listitem>
	</itemizedlist>

	<para>When using pkgsrc on Interix, DO NOT install the Utilities subcomponent
	"UNIX Perl".  That is Perl 5.6 without shared module support, installed to
	/usr/local, and will only cause confusion. Instead, install Perl 5.8 from
	pkgsrc (or from a binary package).</para>

	<para>The Remote Connectivity subcomponent "Windows Remote Shell Service" does
	not need to be installed, but Remote Connectivity itself should be
	installed in order to have a working inetd.</para>

	<para>During installation you may be asked whether to enable setuid
	behavior for Interix programs, and whether to make pathnames default to
	case-sensitive.  Setuid should be enabled, and case-sensitivity MUST be
	enabled.  (Without case-sensitivity, a large number of packages including
	perl will not build.)</para>

	<para>NOTE:  Newer Windows service packs change the way binary execution
	works (via the Data Execution Prevention feature).  In order to use
	pkgsrc and other gcc-compiled binaries reliably, a hotfix containing
	POSIX.EXE, PSXDLL.DLL, PSXRUN.EXE, and PSXSS.EXE (899522 or newer)
	must be installed.  Hotfixes are available from Microsoft through a
	support contract; however, Debian Interix Port has made most Interix
	hotfixes available for personal use from <ulink
	url="http://www.debian-interix.net/hotfixes/">http://www.debian-interix.net/hotfixes/</ulink>.</para>

	<para>In addition to the hotfix noted above, it may be necessary to
	disable Data Execution Prevention entirely to make Interix functional.
	This may happen only with certain types of CPUs; the cause is not fully
	understood at this time.  If gcc or other applications still segfault
	repeatedly after installing one of the hotfixes note above, the
	following option can be added to the appropriate "boot.ini" line on the
	Windows boot drive:  /NoExecute=AlwaysOff
	(WARNING, this will disable DEP completely, which may be a security
	risk if applications are often run as a user in the Administrators
	group!)</para>

	<title>Important notes for using pkgsrc</title>

	<para>The package manager (either the pkgsrc "su" user, or the user
	running "pkg_add") must be a member of the local Administrators
	group.  Such a user must also be used to run the bootstrap.  This is
	slightly relaxed from the normal pkgsrc requirement of "root".</para>

	<para>The package manager should use a umask of 002.  "make install" will
	automatically complain if this is not the case.  This ensures that
	directories written in /var/db/pkg are Administrators-group writeable.</para>

	<para>The popular Interix binary packages from http://www.interopsystems.com/
	use an older version of pkgsrc's pkg_* tools.  Ideally, these should
	NOT be used in conjunction with pkgsrc.  If you choose to use them at
	the same time as the pkgsrc packages, ensure that you use the proper
	pkg_* tools for each type of binary package.</para>

	<para>The TERM setting used for DOS-type console windows (including those

	for a full Unix-like platform, it has some drawbacks that should
	be noted for those desiring to make the most of Interix.</para>

	<itemizedlist>

	  <listitem><para><emphasis role="strong">X11:</emphasis></para>
	  <para>Interix comes with the standard set of X11R6 client libraries,

	  </listitem>

	  <listitem><para><emphasis role="strong">X11 acceleration:</emphasis></para>
	  <para>Because Interix runs in a completely different NT subsystem from
	  Win32 applications, it does not currently support various X11
	  protocol extensions for acceleration (such as MIT-SHM or DGA).
	  Most interactive applications to a local X server will run
	  reasonably fast, but full motion video and other graphics
	  intensive applications may require a faster-than-expected CPU.</para></listitem>

	  <listitem><para><emphasis role="strong">Audio:</emphasis></para>
	  <para>Interix has no native support for audio output.  For audio
	  support, pkgsrc uses the <command>esound</command> client/server
	  audio system on Interix.  Unlike on most platforms, the
	  <filename role="pkg">audio/esound</filename> package does
	  <emphasis>not</emphasis> contain the <command>esd</command>
	  server component.  To output audio via an Interix host, the

	  <listitem><para><emphasis role="strong">CD/DVDs, USB, and SCSI:</emphasis></para>
	  <para>Direct device access is not currently supported in Interix, so it
	  is not currently possible to access CD/DVD drives, USB devices,
	  or SCSI devices through non-filesystem means.  Among other things,
	  this makes it impossible to use Interix directly for CD/DVD
	  burning.</para></listitem>

	  <listitem><para><emphasis role="strong">Tape drives:</emphasis></para>
	  <para>Due to the same limitations as for CD-ROMs and SCSI devices, tape
	  drives are also not directly accessible in Interix.  However,

	<para>It is not necessary, in general, to have a "root" user on the

      <title>IRIX</title>

      <para>You will need a working C compiler, either gcc or SGI's MIPS and MIPSpro
      compiler (cc/c89).  Please set the <varname>CC</varname> environment variable
      according to your preference.  If you do not have a license for the MIPSpro
      compiler suite, you can download a gcc tardist file from <ulink
      url="http://freeware.sgi.com/">http://freeware.sgi.com/</ulink>.</para>

      <para>Please note that you will need IRIX 6.5.17 or higher, as this is the earliest
      version of IRIX providing support for &man.if.indextoname.3;, &man.if.nametoindex.3;,
      etc.</para>

      <para>At this point in time, pkgsrc only supports one ABI at a time.  That is, you cannot
	switch between the old 32-bit ABI, the new 32-bit ABI and the 64-bit ABI.  If
	you start out using "abi=n32", that's what all your packages will be built
	with.</para>

      <para>Therefore, please make sure that you have no conflicting
      <varname>CFLAGS</varname> in your environment or the
      &mk.conf;.  Particularly, make sure that you do not
      try to link n32 object files with lib64 or vice versa.  Check your
      <filename>/etc/compiler.defaults</filename>!</para>

      <para>If you have the actual pkgsrc tree mounted via NFS from a different host,
      please make sure to set <varname>WRKOBJDIR</varname> to a local directory,
      as it appears that IRIX linker occasionally runs into issues when trying to
      link over a network-mounted file system.</para>

      <para>The bootstrapping process should set all the right options for programs such
      as imake(1), but you may want to set some options depending on your local
      setup.  Please see <filename>pkgsrc/mk/defaults/mk.conf</filename> and, of
      course, your compiler's man pages for details.</para>

      <para>If you are using SGI's MIPSPro compiler, please set

      <programlisting>
PKGSRC_COMPILER=        mipspro
      </programlisting>

      in &mk.conf;.  Otherwise, pkgsrc will assume you
      are using gcc and may end up passing invalid flags to the compiler.  Note that
      bootstrap should create an appropriate <filename>mk.conf.example</filename> by
      default.</para>

      <para>If you have both the MIPSPro compiler chain installed as well as gcc,
      but want to make sure that MIPSPro is used, please set your <varname>PATH</varname>
      to <emphasis>not</emphasis> include the location of gcc (often
      <filename>/usr/freeware/bin</filename>), and (important) pass the
      '--preserve-path' flag.</para>

    <sect2 id="linux">
      <title>Linux</title>

      <para>Some versions of Linux (for example Debian GNU/Linux) need
      either libtermcap or libcurses (libncurses).  Installing the
      distributions libncurses-dev package (or equivalent) should fix
      the problem.</para>

      <para>pkgsrc supports both gcc (GNU Compiler Collection) and icc
      (Intel C++ Compiler). gcc is the default. icc 8.0 and 8.1 on
      i386 have been tested.</para>

      <para>To bootstrap using icc, assuming the default icc installation
      directory:</para>

      <programlisting>
env CC=/opt/intel_cc_80/bin/icc LDFLAGS=-static-libcxa \
ac_cv___attribute__=yes ./bootstrap
      </programlisting>

      <note>
	<para>icc 8.1 needs the `-i-static' argument instead of -static-libcxa.</para>
      </note>

      <para>icc supports __attribute__, but the GNU configure test uses a nested
      function, which icc does not support. #undef'ing __attribute__ has the
      unfortunate side-effect of breaking many of the Linux header files, which
      cannot be compiled properly without __attribute__. The test must be
      overridden so that __attribute__ is assumed supported by the
      compiler.</para>

      <para>After bootstrapping, you should set <varname>PKGSRC_COMPILER</varname>
      in &mk.conf;:</para>

      <programlisting>
PKGSRC_COMPILER=        icc
      </programlisting>

      <para>The default installation directory for icc is
      <filename>/opt/intel_cc_80</filename>, which
      is also the pkgsrc default. If you have installed it into a different
      directory, set <varname>ICCBASE</varname> in
      &mk.conf;:</para>

      <programlisting>
ICCBASE=                /opt/icc
      </programlisting>

      <para>pkgsrc uses the static linking method of the runtime libraries
      provided by icc, so binaries can be run on other systems which do not
      have the shared libraries installed.</para>

      <para>Libtool, however, extracts a list of libraries from the
      &man.ld.1; command run when linking a C++ shared library and
      records it, throwing away the -Bstatic and -Bdynamic options
      interspersed between the libraries.  This means that
      libtool-linked C++ shared libraries will have a runtime
      dependency on the icc libraries until this is fixed in
      libtool.</para>
