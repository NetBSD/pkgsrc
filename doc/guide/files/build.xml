  <title>The build process</title>

  <para>The basic steps for building a program are always the same.  First the
    program's source (<emphasis>distfile</emphasis>) must be brought to the
    local system and then extracted. After any patches to compile properly
    on &os; are applied, the software can be configured, then built
    (usually by compiling), and finally the generated binaries, etc. can be
    put into place on the system. These are exactly the steps performed by
    the &os; package system, which is implemented as a series of targets
    in a central Makefile, <filename>pkgsrc/mk/bsd.pkg.mk</filename>.</para>

  <sect1 id="build.prefix">
    <title>Program location</title>

    <para>Before outlining the process performed by the &os; package system in
      the next section, here's a brief discussion on where programs are
      installed, and which variables influence this.</para>

    <para>The automatic variable <varname>PREFIX</varname> indicates
      where all files of the final program shall be installed. It is
      usually set to <varname>LOCALBASE</varname>
      (<filename>/usr/pkg</filename>), or <varname>CROSSBASE</varname>
      for pkgs in the <quote>cross</quote> category.  The value of
      <varname>PREFIX</varname> needs to be put 
      into the various places in the program's source where paths to
      these files are encoded.  See <xref
      linkend="components.patches"/> and <xref
      linkend="fixes.libtool"/> for more details.</para>

    <para>When choosing which of these variables to use,
      follow the following rules:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para><varname>PREFIX</varname> always points to the location where the current
	  pkg will be installed.  When referring to a pkg's own installation path,
	  use <quote>${PREFIX}</quote>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><varname>LOCALBASE</varname> is where all non-X11 pkgs are installed.
	  If you need to construct a -I or -L argument to the compiler to find
	  includes and libraries installed by another non-X11 pkg, use
	  <quote>${LOCALBASE}</quote>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><varname>X11BASE</varname> is where the actual X11 distribution (from
	  xsrc, etc.) is installed. When looking for
	  <emphasis>standard</emphasis> X11 includes (not
	  those installed by a pkg), use <quote>${X11BASE}</quote>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>X11 based are special in that they may be installed in either
	  <varname>X11BASE</varname> or <varname>LOCALBASE</varname>.</para>

	<para>Usually, X11 packages should be installed under
	  <varname>LOCALBASE</varname> whenever possible.  Note that you will
	  need to set <varname>USE_X11</varname> in them to request the
	  presence of X11 and to get the right compilation flags.</para>

	<para>Even though, there are some packages that cannot be installed
	  under <varname>LOCALBASE</varname>: those that come with app-defaults
	  files. These packages are special and they must be placed under
	  <varname>X11BASE</varname>. To accomplish this, set either
	  <varname>USE_X11BASE</varname> or <varname>USE_IMAKE</varname> in
	  your package.</para>

	<para>Some notes: <varname>USE_X11</varname> and
	  <varname>USE_X11BASE</varname> are mutually exclusive. If you need
	  to find includes or libraries installed by a pkg that has
	  <varname>USE_IMAKE</varname> or <varname>USE_X11BASE</varname> in
	  its pkg <filename>Makefile</filename>, you need to use
	  <emphasis>both</emphasis> <filename>${X11BASE}</filename> and
	  <filename>${LOCALBASE}</filename>. To force installation of
	  all X11 packages in <varname>LOCALBASE</varname>, the 
	  <pkg>pkgtools/xpkgwedge</pkg> is enabled by default.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><varname>X11PREFIX</varname> should be used to refer to the installed
	  location of an X11 package. <varname>X11PREFIX</varname> will be set to
	  <varname>X11BASE</varname> if xpkgwedge is not installed,
	  and to <varname>LOCALBASE</varname> if xpkgwedge is installed.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>If xpkgwedge is installed, it is possible to have some packages installed
	  in <varname>X11BASE</varname> and some in <varname>LOCALBASE</varname>.
	  To determine the prefix of an installed package, the
	  <varname>EVAL_PREFIX</varname> definition can be used. It takes pairs in the
	  format <quote>DIRNAME=&lt;package&gt;</quote>, and the &man.make.1; variable
	  <varname>DIRNAME</varname> will be set to the prefix of the installed
	  package &lt;package&gt;, or <quote>${X11PREFIX}</quote> if the package is
	  not installed.</para>

	<para>This is best illustrated by example.</para>

	<para>The following lines are taken from
	  <filename>pkgsrc/wm/scwm/Makefile</filename>:</para>

	<programlisting>EVAL_PREFIX+=		GTKDIR=gtk+
CONFIGURE_ARGS+=	--with-guile-prefix=${LOCALBASE}	\
			--with-gtk-prefix="${GTKDIR}"		\
			--enable-multibyte</programlisting>

	<para>Specific defaults can be defined for the packages evaluated using
	  <varname>EVAL_PREFIX</varname>, by using a definition of the form:</para>

	<programlisting>GTKDIR_DEFAULT= ${LOCALBASE}</programlisting>

	<para>where <varname>GTKDIR</varname> corresponds
	  to the first definition in
	  the <varname>EVAL_PREFIX</varname> pair.</para>
      </listitem>
      
      <listitem>
        <para>Within <filename>${PREFIX}</filename>, packages should
          install files according to &man.hier.7;, with the exception that
          manual pages go into <filename>${PREFIX}/man</filename>, not
          <filename>${PREFIX}/share/man</filename>.</para> 
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    <title>Main targets</title>

    <para>The main targets used during the build process defined in
      <filename>bsd.pkg.mk</filename> are:</para>

    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
	<term>fetch</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>This will check if the file(s) given in the variables
	    <varname>DISTFILES</varname> and <varname>PATCHFILES</varname> (as
	    defined in the package's Makefile) are present on the
	    local system in <filename>/usr/pkgsrc/distfiles</filename>. If they
	    are not present, an attempt will be made to fetch them using commands
	    of the form:</para>

	  <programlisting>${FETCH_CMD} ${FETCH_BEFORE_ARGS} ${site}${file} ${FETCH_AFTER_ARGS}</programlisting>

	  <para>where ${site} varies through several possibilities in turn: first,
	    <varname>MASTER_SITE_OVERRIDE</varname> is tried, then the sites
	    specified in either <varname>SITES_file</varname> if defined, else
	    <varname>MASTER_SITES</varname> or <varname>PATCH_SITES</varname>, as
	    applies, then finally the value of
	    <varname>MASTER_SITE_BACKUP</varname>. The order of all except the
	    first can be optionally sorted by the user, via setting either
	    <varname>MASTER_SORT_AWK</varname> or
	    <varname>MASTER_SORT_REGEX</varname>.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>checksum</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>After the distfile(s) are fetched, their checksum is generated and
	    compared with the checksums stored in the distinfo file. If the
	    checksums don't match, the build is aborted. This is to ensure the same
	    distfile is used for building, and that the distfile wasn't changed,
	    e.g. by some malign force, deliberately changed distfiles on the master
	    distribution site or network lossage.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>extract</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>When the distfiles are present on the local system,
	    they need to be extracted, as they are usually in the form
	    of some compressed archive format, most commonly
	    <filename>.tar.gz</filename>. </para>

	  <para> If only some of the
	    distfiles need to be uncompressed, the files to be
	    uncompressed should be put into
	    <varname>EXTRACT_ONLY</varname>.</para>

	  <para> If the distfiles are not in
	    <filename>.tar.gz</filename> format, they can be extracted
	    by setting either <varname>EXTRACT_SUFX</varname>, or
	    <varname>EXTRACT_CMD</varname>,
	    <varname>EXTRACT_BEFORE_ARGS</varname> and
	    <varname>EXTRACT_AFTER_ARGS</varname>. In the former case,
	    pkgsrc knows how to extract a number of suffixes
	    (<filename>.tar.gz</filename>, <filename>.tgz</filename>,
	    <filename>.tar.gz2</filename>, <filename>.tbz</filename>,
	    <filename>.tar.Z</filename>, <filename>.tar</filename>,
	    <filename>.shar.gz</filename>,
	    <filename>.shar.bz2</filename>,
	    <filename>.shar.Z</filename>, <filename>.shar</filename>,
	    <filename>.Z</filename>, <filename>.bz2</filename> and
	    <filename>.gz</filename>; see the definition of the
	    various <varname>DECOMPRESS_CMD</varname> variables
	    <filename>bsd.pkg.mk</filename> for a complete
	    list). Here's an example on how to use the other variables
	    for a program that comes with a compressed shell archive
	    whose name ends in <filename>.msg.gz</filename>:</para>

	  <programlisting>     EXTRACT_SUFX=   .msg.gz
     EXTRACT_CMD=            zcat
     EXTRACT_BEFORE_ARGS=
     EXTRACT_AFTER_ARGS=     |sh</programlisting>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>patch</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>After extraction, all the patches named by the
	    <varname>PATCHFILES</varname>, those present in the patches
	    subdirectory of the package as well as in $LOCALPATCHES/$PKGPATH (e.g.
	    <filename>/usr/local/patches/graphics/png</filename>) are applied.
	    Patchfiles ending in <filename>.Z</filename> or
	    <filename>.gz</filename> are uncompressed before they are applied,
	    files ending in <filename>.orig</filename> or
	    <filename>.rej</filename> are ignored. Any special options to &man.patch.1;
	    can be handed in <varname>PATCH_DIST_ARGS</varname>.
	    See <xref linkend="components.patches"/> for more details.</para>

	  <para>By default &man.patch.1; is given special args to make it fail if the
	    patches apply with some lines of fuzz. Please fix (regen) the patches
	    so that they apply cleanly. The rationale behind this is that
	    patches that don't apply cleanly may end up being applied in the wrong
	    place, and cause severe harm there.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>configure</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Most pieces of software need information on the header files,
	    system calls, and library routines which are available in &os;.
	    This is the process known as configuration, and is usually
	    automated.  In most cases, a script is supplied with the source,
	    and its invocation results in generation of header files,
	    Makefiles, etc.</para>

	  <para>If the program's distfile contains its own configure
	    script, this can be invoked by setting
	    <varname>HAS_CONFIGURE</varname>. If the configure script
	    is a GNU autoconf script, <varname>GNU_CONFIGURE</varname>
	    should be specified instead. In either case, any arguments
	    to the configure script can be specified in the
	    <varname>CONFIGURE_ARGS</varname> variable, and the
	    configure script's name can be set in
	    <varname>CONFIGURE_SCRIPT</varname> if it differs from the
	    default <quote>configure</quote>. Here's an example from
	    the <pkg>sysutils/top</pkg> package:</para>

	  <programlisting>HAS_CONFIGURE=          yes
CONFIGURE_SCRIPT=       Configure
CONFIGURE_ARGS+=        netbsd13</programlisting>

	  <para>If the program uses an Imakefile for configuration, the appropriate
	    steps can be invoked by setting <varname>USE_IMAKE</varname> to
	    <quote>YES</quote>. (If you only want the package installed in
	    <varname>$X11PREFIX</varname> but xmkmf not being run, set
	    <varname>USE_X11BASE</varname> instead!)</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>build</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Once configuration has taken place, the software will be built 
	    by invoking <varname>$MAKE_PROGRAM</varname> on
	    <varname>$MAKEFILE</varname> with <varname>$BUILD_TARGET</varname> as
	    the target to build.  The default <varname>MAKE_PROGRAM</varname> is
	    <quote>gmake</quote> if <varname>USE_GNU_TOOLS</varname> contains <quote>make</quote>,
	    <quote>make</quote> otherwise. <varname>MAKEFILE</varname> is set to
	    <quote>Makefile</quote> by default, and <varname>BUILD_TARGET</varname>
	    defaults to <quote>all</quote>.  Any of these variables
	    can be set in the package's Makefile to change the default
	    build process.</para> 
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>install</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Once the build stage has completed, the final step is to install
	    the software in public directories, so users can access
	    the programs and files.  As in the
	    build-target, <varname>$MAKE_PROGRAM</varname> is invoked on
	    <varname>$MAKEFILE</varname> here, but with the
	    <varname>$INSTALL_TARGET</varname> instead, the latter defaulting to
	    <quote>install</quote> (plus <quote>install.man</quote>, if
	    <varname>USE_IMAKE</varname> is set).</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>

    <para>If no target is specified, the default is <quote>build</quote>.
      If a subsequent stage is requested, all prior stages are made: e.g.
      <command>make build</command> will also perform the equivalent of:</para>

    <programlisting>
make fetch
make checksum
make extract
make patch
make configure
make build</programlisting>

	<term>update</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>This target causes the current package to be updated to the latest
	    version.  The package and all depending packages first get de-installed,
	    then current versions of the corresponding packages get compiled and
	    installed.  This is similar to manually noting which packages are
	    currently installed, then performing a series of <command>make
	      deinstall</command> and <command>make install</command> (or whatever
	    <varname>UPDATE_TARGET</varname> is set to) for these packages.</para>

	  <para>You can use the <quote>update</quote> target to resume package

	    ability to automatically update the current package along with the
	    dependent packages you have installed.</para>

	  <para>Resuming an interrupted <command>make update</command> will only work as

	    <varname>FTP_PKG_URL_HOST</varname> and
	    <varname>FTP_PKG_URL_DIR</varname>. For example, if I wanted to generate
	    <filename>README.html</filename> files which pointed to binary packages
	    on the local machine, in the directory
	    <filename>/usr/packages</filename>, set
	    <varname>FTP_PKG_URL_HOST=file://localhost</varname> and
	    <varname>FTP_PKG_URL_DIR=/usr/packages</varname>. The
	    <varname>${PACKAGES}</varname> directory and its subdirectories will be
	    searched for all the binary packages.</para>

	<term>readme-all</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Use this target to create a file <filename>README-all.html</filename>
	    which contains a list of all packages currently available in the &os;
	    Packages Collection, together with the category they belong to and a
	    short description. This file is compiled from the
	    <filename>pkgsrc/*/README.html</filename> files, so be sure to run
	    this <emphasis>after</emphasis> a <command>make readme</command>.</para>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>cdrom-readme</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>This is very much the same as the <quote>readme</quote> target (see
	    above), but is to be used when generating a pkgsrc tree to be written
	    to a CD-ROM.  This target also produces
	    <filename>README.html</filename> files, and can be made to refer
	    to URLs based on <varname>CDROM_PKG_URL_HOST</varname> and
	    <varname>CDROM_PKG_URL_DIR</varname>.</para>
	</listitem>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>show-distfiles</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>This target shows which distfiles and patchfiles are needed to build
	    the package. (<varname>DISTFILES</varname> and
	    <varname>PATCHFILES</varname>, but not <filename>patches/*</filename>)</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>show-downlevel</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>This target shows nothing if the package is not installed. If a version
	    of this package is installed, but is not the version provided in this
	    version of pkgsrc, then a warning message is displayed. This target can
	    be used to show which of your installed packages are downlevel, and so
	    the old versions can be deleted, and the current ones added.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>show-pkgsrc-dir</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>This target shows the directory in the pkgsrc hierarchy from which the
	    package can be built and installed. This may not be the same directory
	    as the one from which the package was installed. This target is intended
	    to be used by people who may wish to upgrade many packages on a single
	    host, and can be invoked from the top-level pkgsrc Makefile by using the
	    <quote>show-host-specific-pkgs</quote> target.</para>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>show-installed-depends</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>This target shows which installed packages match the current package's

	<term>check-shlibs</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>After a package is installed, check all its binaries and (on ELF
	    platforms) shared libraries to see if they find the shared libs they need.

	<term>print-PLIST</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>After a <quote>make install</quote> from a new or
	    upgraded pkg, this prints out an attempt to generate a new
	    <filename>PLIST</filename> from a <command>find -newer
	    work/.extract_done</command>.  An attempt is made to care
	    for shared libs etc., but it is
	    <emphasis>strongly</emphasis> recommended to review the
	    result before putting it into
	    <filename>PLIST</filename>. On upgrades, it's useful to
	    diff the output of this command against an already
	    existing <filename>PLIST</filename> file.</para>

	  <para>If the package installs files via &man.tar.1; or other
	    methods that don't update file access times, be sure to
	    add these files manually to your
	    <filename>PLIST</filename>, as the <quote>find
	    -newer</quote> command used by this target won't catch
	    them!</para>

	<term>bulk-package</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Used to do bulk builds. If an appropriate binary package already exists,
	    no action is taken. If not, this target will compile, install and
	    package it (and it's depends, if <varname>PKG_DEPENDS</varname> is
	    set properly. See <xref linkend="binary.configuration"/>.
	    After creating the binary
	    package, the sources, the just-installed package and it's required
	    packages are removed, preserving free disk space.</para>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>bulk-install</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Used during bulk-installs to install required packages. If an
	    upto-date binary package is available, it will be installed via
	    &man.pkg.add.1;. If not, <command>make bulk-package</command> will be executed,
