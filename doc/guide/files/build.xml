<title>The build process</title>

<sect1 id="build.intro">
<title>Introduction</title>

<para>This chapter gives a detailed description on how a package is
built. Building a package is separated into different
<emphasis>phases</emphasis> (for example <varname>fetch</varname>,
<varname>build</varname>, <varname>install</varname>), all of which are
described in the following sections. Each phase is splitted into
so-called <emphasis>stages</emphasis>, which take the name of the
containing phase, prefixed by one of <varname>pre-</varname>,
<varname>do-</varname> or <varname>post-</varname>. (Examples are
<varname>pre-configure</varname>, <varname>post-build</varname>.) Most
of the actual work is done in the <varname>do-*</varname> stages.</para>

<para>The basic steps for building a program are always the same.  First
the program's source (<emphasis>distfile</emphasis>) must be brought to
the local system and then extracted. After any pkgsrc-specific patches
to compile properly are applied, the software can be configured, then
built (usually by compiling), and finally the generated binaries, etc.
can be put into place on the system.</para>

</sect1>

  <sect1 id="build.prefix">
    <title>Program location</title>

    <para>Before outlining the process performed by the &os; package system in
      the next section, here's a brief discussion on where programs are
      installed, and which variables influence this.</para>

    <para>The automatic variable <varname>PREFIX</varname> indicates
      where all files of the final program shall be installed. It is
      usually set to <varname>LOCALBASE</varname>
      (<filename>/usr/pkg</filename>), or <varname>CROSSBASE</varname>
      for pkgs in the <quote>cross</quote> category.  The value of
      <varname>PREFIX</varname> needs to be put 
      into the various places in the program's source where paths to
      these files are encoded.  See <xref
      linkend="components.patches"/> and <xref
      linkend="fixes.libtool"/> for more details.</para>

    <para>When choosing which of these variables to use,
      follow the following rules:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para><varname>PREFIX</varname> always points to the location where the current
	  pkg will be installed.  When referring to a pkg's own installation path,
	  use <quote>${PREFIX}</quote>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><varname>LOCALBASE</varname> is where all non-X11 pkgs are installed.
	  If you need to construct a -I or -L argument to the compiler to find
	  includes and libraries installed by another non-X11 pkg, use
	  <quote>${LOCALBASE}</quote>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><varname>X11BASE</varname> is where the actual X11 distribution (from
	  xsrc, etc.) is installed. When looking for
	  <emphasis>standard</emphasis> X11 includes (not
	  those installed by a pkg), use <quote>${X11BASE}</quote>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>X11-based packages are special in that they may be installed in
	  either <varname>X11BASE</varname> or <varname>LOCALBASE</varname>.</para>

	<para>Usually, X11 packages should be installed under
	  <varname>LOCALBASE</varname> whenever possible.  Note that you will
	  need to include <filename>../../mk/x11.buildlink3.mk</filename>
	  in them to request the
	  presence of X11 and to get the right compilation flags.</para>

	<para>Even though, there are some packages that cannot be installed
	  under <varname>LOCALBASE</varname>: those that come with app-defaults
	  files. These packages are special and they must be placed under
	  <varname>X11BASE</varname>. To accomplish this, set either
	  <varname>USE_X11BASE</varname> or <varname>USE_IMAKE</varname> in
	  your package.</para>

	<para>Some notes: If you need
	  to find includes or libraries installed by a pkg that has
	  <varname>USE_IMAKE</varname> or <varname>USE_X11BASE</varname> in
	  its pkg <filename>Makefile</filename>, you need to look in
	  <emphasis>both</emphasis> <filename>${X11BASE}</filename> and
	  <filename>${LOCALBASE}</filename>. To force installation of
	  all X11 packages in <varname>LOCALBASE</varname>, the 
	  <filename role="pkg">pkgtools/xpkgwedge</filename> package 
	  is enabled by default.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><varname>X11PREFIX</varname> should be used to refer to the installed
	  location of an X11 package. <varname>X11PREFIX</varname> will be set to
	  <varname>X11BASE</varname> if xpkgwedge is not installed,
	  and to <varname>LOCALBASE</varname> if xpkgwedge is installed.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>If xpkgwedge is installed, it is possible to have some packages installed
	  in <varname>X11BASE</varname> and some in <varname>LOCALBASE</varname>.
	  To determine the prefix of an installed package, the
	  <varname>EVAL_PREFIX</varname> definition can be used. It takes pairs in the
	  format <quote>DIRNAME=&lt;package&gt;</quote>, and the &man.make.1; variable
	  <varname>DIRNAME</varname> will be set to the prefix of the installed
	  package &lt;package&gt;, or <quote>${X11PREFIX}</quote> if the package is
	  not installed.</para>

	<para>This is best illustrated by example.</para>

	<para>The following lines are taken from
	  <filename>pkgsrc/wm/scwm/Makefile</filename>:</para>

<programlisting>
    EVAL_PREFIX+=           GTKDIR=gtk+
    CONFIGURE_ARGS+=        --with-guile-prefix=${LOCALBASE}        \
                            --with-gtk-prefix="${GTKDIR}"           \
                            --enable-multibyte
</programlisting>

	<para>Specific defaults can be defined for the packages evaluated using
	  <varname>EVAL_PREFIX</varname>, by using a definition of the form:</para>

<programlisting>
    GTKDIR_DEFAULT= ${LOCALBASE}
</programlisting>

	<para>where <varname>GTKDIR</varname> corresponds
	  to the first definition in
	  the <varname>EVAL_PREFIX</varname> pair.</para>
      </listitem>
      
      <listitem>
        <para>Within <filename>${PREFIX}</filename>, packages should
          install files according to &man.hier.7;, with the exception that
          manual pages go into <filename>${PREFIX}/man</filename>, not
          <filename>${PREFIX}/share/man</filename>.</para> 
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
  </sect1>

<sect1 id="build.builddirs">
<title>Directories used during the build process</title>

<para>When building a package, a number of directories is used to store
source files, temporary files, pkgsrc-internal files, and so on. These
directories are explained here.</para>

<para>Some of the directory variables contain relative pathnames. There
are two common base directories for these relative directories:
<varname>PKGSRCDIR/PKGPATH</varname> is used for directories that are
pkgsrc-specific. <varname>WRKSRC</varname> is used for directories
inside the package itself.</para>

<variablelist>

<varlistentry><term><varname>PKGSRCDIR</varname></term>
<listitem><para>This is an absolute pathname that points to the pkgsrc
root directory. Generally, you don't need
it.</para></listitem></varlistentry>

<varlistentry><term><varname>PKGPATH</varname></term>
<listitem><para>This is a pathname relative to
<varname>PKGSRCDIR</varname> that points to the current
package.</para></listitem></varlistentry>

<varlistentry><term><varname>WRKDIR</varname></term>
<listitem><para>This is an absolute pathname pointing to the directory
where all work takes place. The distfiles are extraced to this
directory. It also contains temporary directories and log files used by
the various pkgsrc frameworks, like <emphasis>buildlink</emphasis> or
the <emphasis>wrappers</emphasis>.</para></listitem></varlistentry>

<varlistentry><term><varname>WRKSRC</varname></term>
<listitem><para>This is an absolute pathname pointing to the directory
where the distfiles are extracted. It is usually a direct subdirectory
of <varname>WRKDIR</varname>, and often it's the only directory entry
that isn't hidden. This variable may be changed by a package
<filename>Makefile</filename>.</para></listitem></varlistentry>

</variablelist>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="build.running">
<title>Running a phase</title>

<para>You can run a particular phase by typing <command>make
phase</command>, where <emphasis>phase</emphasis> is the name of the
phase. This will automatically run all phases that are required for this
phase. The default phase is <varname>build</varname>, that is, when you
run <command>make</command> without parameters in a package directory,
the package will be built, but not installed.</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="build.fetch">
<title>The <emphasis>fetch</emphasis> phase</title>

	  <para>This will check if the file(s) given in the variables
	    <varname>DISTFILES</varname> and <varname>PATCHFILES</varname> (as
	    defined in the package's Makefile) are present on the
	    local system in <filename>/usr/pkgsrc/distfiles</filename>. If they
	    are not present, an attempt will be made to fetch them using commands
	    of the form:</para>

<programlisting>
    ${FETCH_CMD} ${FETCH_BEFORE_ARGS} ${site}${file} ${FETCH_AFTER_ARGS}
</programlisting>

	  <para>where ${site} varies through several possibilities in turn: first,
	    <varname>MASTER_SITE_OVERRIDE</varname> is tried, then the sites
	    specified in either <varname>SITES_file</varname> if defined, else
	    <varname>MASTER_SITES</varname> or <varname>PATCH_SITES</varname>, as
	    applies, then finally the value of
	    <varname>MASTER_SITE_BACKUP</varname>. The order of all except the
	    first can be optionally sorted by the user, via setting either
	    <varname>MASTER_SORT_AWK</varname> or
	    <varname>MASTER_SORT_REGEX</varname>.</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="build.checksum">
<title>The <emphasis>checksum</emphasis> phase</title>

	  <para>After the distfile(s) are fetched, their checksum is generated and
	    compared with the checksums stored in the distinfo file. If the
	    checksums don't match, the build is aborted. This is to ensure the same
	    distfile is used for building, and that the distfile wasn't changed,
	    e.g. by some malign force, deliberately changed distfiles on the master
	    distribution site or network lossage.</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="build.extract">
<title>The <emphasis>extract</emphasis> phase</title>

	  <para>When the distfiles are present on the local system,
	    they need to be extracted, as they are usually in the form
	    of some compressed archive format, most commonly
	    <filename>.tar.gz</filename>. </para>

	  <para> If only some of the
	    distfiles need to be uncompressed, the files to be
	    uncompressed should be put into
	    <varname>EXTRACT_ONLY</varname>.</para>

	  <para> If the distfiles are not in
	    <filename>.tar.gz</filename> format, they can be extracted
	    by setting either <varname>EXTRACT_SUFX</varname>, or
	    <varname>EXTRACT_CMD</varname>,
	    <varname>EXTRACT_BEFORE_ARGS</varname> and
	    <varname>EXTRACT_AFTER_ARGS</varname>. In the former case,
	    pkgsrc knows how to extract a number of suffixes
	    (<filename>.tar.gz</filename>, <filename>.tgz</filename>,
	    <filename>.tar.gz2</filename>, <filename>.tbz</filename>,
	    <filename>.tar.Z</filename>, <filename>.tar</filename>,
	    <filename>.shar.gz</filename>,
	    <filename>.shar.bz2</filename>,
	    <filename>.shar.Z</filename>, <filename>.shar</filename>,
	    <filename>.Z</filename>, <filename>.bz2</filename> and
	    <filename>.gz</filename>; see the definition of the
	    various <varname>DECOMPRESS_CMD</varname> variables in
	    <filename>bsd.pkg.extract.mk</filename> for a complete
	    list). Here's an example on how to use the other variables
	    for a program that comes with a compressed shell archive
	    whose name ends in <filename>.msg.gz</filename>:</para>

<programlisting>
    EXTRACT_SUFX=           .msg.gz
    EXTRACT_CMD=            zcat
    EXTRACT_BEFORE_ARGS=
    EXTRACT_AFTER_ARGS=     |sh
</programlisting>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="build.patch">
<title>The <emphasis>patch</emphasis> phase</title>

	  <para>After extraction, all the patches named by the
	    <varname>PATCHFILES</varname>, those present in the patches
	    subdirectory of the package as well as in $LOCALPATCHES/$PKGPATH (e.g.
	    <filename>/usr/local/patches/graphics/png</filename>) are applied.
	    Patchfiles ending in <filename>.Z</filename> or
	    <filename>.gz</filename> are uncompressed before they are applied,
	    files ending in <filename>.orig</filename> or
	    <filename>.rej</filename> are ignored. Any special options to &man.patch.1;
	    can be handed in <varname>PATCH_DIST_ARGS</varname>.
	    See <xref linkend="components.patches"/> for more details.</para>

	  <para>By default &man.patch.1; is given special args to make it fail if the
	    patches apply with some lines of fuzz. Please fix (regen) the patches
	    so that they apply cleanly. The rationale behind this is that
	    patches that don't apply cleanly may end up being applied in the wrong
	    place, and cause severe harm there.</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="build.configure">
<title>The <emphasis>configure</emphasis> phase</title>

<para>Most pieces of software need information on the header files,
system calls, and library routines which are available on the platform
they run on. The process of determining this information is known as
configuration, and is usually automated. In most cases, a script is
supplied with the distfiles, and its invocation results in generation of
header files, Makefiles, etc.</para>

<para>If the package contains a configure script, this can be invoked by
setting <varname>HAS_CONFIGURE</varname> to <quote>yes</quote>. If the
configure script is a GNU autoconf script, you should set
<varname>GNU_CONFIGURE</varname> to <quote>yes</quote> instead. What
happens in the <emphasis>configure</emphasis> phase is roughly:</para>

<programlisting>
    .for d in ${CONFIGURE_DIRS}
            cd ${WRKSRC} && cd ${d} && env ${CONFIGURE_ENV} \
                ${CONFIGURE_SCRIPT} ${CONFIGURE_ARGS}
    .endfor
</programlisting>

<para><varname>CONFIGURE_DIRS</varname> (default: <quote>.</quote>) is a
list of pathnames relative to <varname>WRKSRC</varname>. In each of
these directories, the configure script is run with the environment
<varname>CONFIGURE_ENV</varname> and arguments
<varname>CONFIGURE_ARGS</varname>. The variables
<varname>CONFIGURE_ENV</varname>, <varname>CONFIGURE_SCRIPT</varname>
(default: <quote>./configure</quote>) and
<varname>CONFIGURE_ARGS</varname> may all be changed by the
package.</para>

<para>If the program uses an <filename>Imakefile</filename> for
configuration, the appropriate steps can be invoked by setting
<varname>USE_IMAKE</varname> to <quote>yes</quote>. (If you only want
the package installed in <varname>${X11PREFIX}</varname> but xmkmf not
being run, set <varname>USE_X11BASE</varname> instead.)</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="build.build">
<title>The <emphasis>build</emphasis> phase</title>

<para>For building a package, a rough equivalent of the following code
is executed.</para>

<programlisting>
    .for d in ${BUILD_DIRS}
            cd ${WRKSRC} && cd ${d} && env ${MAKE_ENV} \
                ${MAKE_PROGRAM} ${BUILD_MAKE_FLAGS} \
                    -f ${MAKEFILE} ${BUILD_TARGET}
    .endfor
</programlisting>

<para><varname>BUILD_DIRS</varname> (default: <quote>.</quote>) is a
list of pathnames relative to <varname>WRKSRC</varname>. In each of
these directories, <varname>MAKE_PROGRAM</varname> is run with the
environment <varname>MAKE_ENV</varname> and arguments
<varname>BUILD_MAKE_FLAGS</varname>. The variables
<varname>MAKE_ENV</varname>, <varname>BUILD_MAKE_FLAGS</varname>,
<varname>MAKEFILE</varname> and <varname>BUILD_TARGET</varname> may all
be changed by the package.</para>

<para>The default value of <varname>MAKE_PROGRAM</varname> is
<quote>gmake</quote> if <varname>USE_TOOLS</varname> contains
<quote>gmake</quote>, <quote>make</quote> otherwise. The default value
of <varname>MAKEFILE</varname> is <quote>Makefile</quote>, and
<varname>BUILD_TARGET</varname> defaults to <quote>all</quote>.</para>

	<para>Once the build stage has completed, the final step is to
	install the software in public directories, so users can access
	the programs and files.</para>

	<para>In the <emphasis>install</emphasis> phase, a rough
	equivalent of the following code is executed. Additionally,
	before and after this code, much magic is performed to do
	consistency checks, registering the package, and so on.</para>

<programlisting>
    .for d in ${INSTALL_DIRS}

</programlisting>

	<para>The variable's meanings are analogous to the ones in the
	<emphasis>build</emphasis> phase.
	<varname>INSTALL_DIRS</varname> defaults to
	<varname>BUILD_DIRS</varname>. <varname>INSTALL_TARGET</varname>
	is <quote>install</quote> by default, plus
	<quote>install.man</quote> if <varname>USE_IMAKE</varname> is

	<para>In the <emphasis>install</emphasis> phase, the following

	    currently installed, then performing a series of <command>make
	      deinstall</command> and <command>make install</command> (or whatever
	    <varname>UPDATE_TARGET</varname> is set to) for these packages.</para>

	  <para>You can use the <quote>update</quote> target to resume package
	    updating in case a previous <command>make update</command> was interrupted
	    for some reason.  However, in this case, make sure you don't call
	    <command>make clean</command> or otherwise remove the list of dependent
	    packages in <varname>WRKDIR</varname>.  Otherwise, you lose the
	    ability to automatically update the current package along with the
	    dependent packages you have installed.</para>

	  <para>Resuming an interrupted <command>make update</command> will only work as
	    long as the package tree remains unchanged.  If the source code for
	    one of the packages to be updated has been changed, resuming
	    <command>make update</command> will most certainly fail!</para>

	    as the one from which the package was installed. This target is intended
	    to be used by people who may wish to upgrade many packages on a single

	<term>print-PLIST</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>After a <quote>make install</quote> from a new or

	    <emphasis>strongly</emphasis> recommended to review the
	    result before putting it into
	    <filename>PLIST</filename>. On upgrades, it's useful to
	    diff the output of this command against an already

	  <para>If the package installs files via &man.tar.1; or other
