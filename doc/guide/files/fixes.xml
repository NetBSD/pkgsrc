<title>Portability of packages</title>

	<para>One appealing feature of pkgsrc is that it runs on many
	different platforms. As a result, it is important to ensure,
	where possible, that packages in pkgsrc are portable. This
	chapter mentions some particular details you should pay
	attention to while working on pkgsrc.</para>

    <sect2 id="pulling-vars-from-etc-mk.conf">
      <title>How to pull in user-settable variables from <filename>mk.conf</filename></title>

	<para>The pkgsrc user can configure pkgsrc by overriding several
	variables in the file pointed to by <varname>MAKECONF</varname>,
	which is <filename>/etc/mk.conf</filename> by default. When you
	want to use those variables in the preprocessor directives of
	&man.make.1; (for example <literal>.if</literal> or
	<literal>.for</literal>), you need to include the file
	<filename>../../mk/bsd.prefs.mk</filename> before, which in turn
	loads the user preferences.</para>

	<para>But note that some variables may not be completely defined
	after <filename>../../mk/bsd.prefs.mk</filename> has been
	included, as they may contain references to variables that are
	not yet defined. In shell commands this is no problem, since
	variables are actually macros, which are only expanded when they
	are used. But in the preprocessor directives mentioned above and
	in dependency lines (of the form <literal>target:
	dependencies</literal>) the variables are expanded at load
	time.</para>

	<note><para>Currently there is no exhaustive list of all
	variables that tells you whether they can be used at load time
	or only at run time, but it is in preparation.</para></note>

    <sect2 id="handling-licenses">
      <title>Handling licenses</title>

      <para>A package may be covered by a license which the user has
        or has not agreed to accept.  For these cases, pkgsrc contains
        a mechanism to note that a package is covered by a particular
        license, and the package cannot be built unless the user has
        accepted the license.  (Installation of binary packages are
        not currently subject to this mechanism.)  Packages with
        licenses that are either Open Source according to the Open
        Source Initiative or Free according to the Free Software
        Foundation will not be marked with a license tag.  Packages
        with licenses that have not been determined to meet either
        definition will be marked with a license tag referring to the
        license.  This will prevent building unless pkgsrc is informed
        that the license is acceptable, and enables displaying the
        license.</para>

      <para>The license tag mechanism is intended to address
	copyright-related issues surrounding building, installing and
	using a package, and not to address redistribution issues (see
	<varname>RESTRICTED</varname> and
	<varname>NO_SRC_ON_FTP</varname>, etc.).  However, the above
	definition of licenses for which tags are not needed implies
	that packages with redistribution restrictions should have
	tags.</para>

      <para>
        Denoting that a package is covered by a particular license is
        done by placing the license in
        <filename>pkgsrc/licenses</filename> and setting the
        <varname>LICENSE</varname> variable to a string identifying
        the license, e.g. in
	<filename role="pkg">graphics/xv</filename>: </para>

<programlisting>
    LICENSE=        xv-license
</programlisting>

      <para>
	When trying to build, the user will get a notice that the
        package is covered by a license which has not been
        accepted:</para>

<programlisting>
    &cprompt; <userinput>make</userinput>
    ===> xv-3.10anb9 has an unacceptable license: xv-license.
    ===>     To view the license, enter "/usr/bin/make show-license".
    ===>     To indicate acceptance, add this line to your /etc/mk.conf:
    ===>     ACCEPTABLE_LICENSES+=xv-license
    *** Error code 1
</programlisting>

        <para>The license can be viewed with <command>make
          show-license</command>, and if it is considered appropriate,
          the line printed above can be added to
          <filename>/etc/mk.conf</filename> to indicate acceptance of
          the particular license:</para>

<programlisting>
    ACCEPTABLE_LICENSES+=xv-license
</programlisting>

	<para>When adding a package with a new license, the license
          text should be added to <filename>pkgsrc/licenses</filename>
          for displaying. A list of known licenses can be seen in this
          directory as well as by looking at the list of (commented
          out) <varname>ACCEPTABLE_LICENSES</varname> variable
          settings in
          <filename>pkgsrc/mk/defaults/mk.conf</filename>.</para>

	<para>The use of <varname>LICENSE=shareware</varname>,
	  <varname>LICENSE=no-commercial-use</varname>, and similar
	  language is deprecated because it does not crisply refer to
	  a particular license text.  Another problem with such usage
	  is that it does not enable a user to denote acceptance of
	  the license for a single package without accepting the same
	  license text for another package.  In particular, this can
	  be inappropriate when e.g. one accepts a particular license to
	  indicate to pkgsrc that a fee has been paid.</para>

    <sect2 id="restricted-packages">
      <title>Restricted packages</title>

      <para>Some licenses restrict how software may be re-distributed.
        In order to satisfy these restrictions, the package system
        defines five make variables that can be set to note these
        restrictions:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><varname>RESTRICTED</varname></para>

          <para>This variable should be set whenever a restriction
            exists (regardless of its kind).  Set this variable to a
            string containing the reason for the restriction.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><varname>NO_BIN_ON_CDROM</varname></para>

          <para>Binaries may not be placed on CD-ROM.  Set this

            not allowed on CD-ROMs.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><varname>NO_SRC_ON_FTP</varname></para>

            allowed.</para>

      <para>Please note that the use of <varname>NO_PACKAGE</varname>,
        <varname>IGNORE</varname>, <varname>NO_CDROM</varname>, or other
        generic make variables to denote restrictions is deprecated,
        because they unconditionally prevent users from generating
        binary packages!</para>
    </sect2>


    <sect2 id="dependencies">
      <title>Handling dependencies</title>

      <para>Your package may depend on some other package being present
        - and there are various ways of expressing this
        dependency. pkgsrc supports the <varname>BUILD_DEPENDS</varname>
        and <varname>DEPENDS</varname> definitions, the
        <varname>USE_TOOLS</varname> definition, as well as
        dependencies via <filename>buildlink3.mk</filename>, which is
        the preferred way to handle dependencies, and which uses the
        variables named above. See <xref linkend="buildlink"/> for more
        information.</para>

      <para>The basic difference between the two variables is as
        follows: The <varname>DEPENDS</varname> definition registers
        that pre-requisite in the binary package so it will be pulled in
        when the binary package is later installed, whilst the
        <varname>BUILD_DEPENDS</varname> definition does not, marking a
        dependency that is only needed for building the package.
</para>

      <para>This means that if you only need a package present whilst
        you are building, it should be noted as a
        <varname>BUILD_DEPENDS</varname>.</para>

      <para>The format for a <varname>BUILD_DEPENDS</varname> and a
        <varname>DEPENDS</varname> definition is:</para>

<programlisting>
    &lt;pre-req-package-name&gt;:../../&lt;category&gt;/&lt;pre-req-package&gt;
</programlisting>

      <para>Please note that the <quote>pre-req-package-name</quote>
        may include any of the wildcard version numbers recognized by
        &man.pkg.info.1;.</para>

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>If your package needs another package's binaries or
            libraries to build or run, and if that package has a
            <filename>buildlink3.mk</filename> file available, use it:
</para>

<programlisting>
    .include "../../graphics/jpeg/buildlink3.mk"
</programlisting>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>If your package needs to use another package to build
            itself and there is no <filename>buildlink3.mk</filename>
            file available, use the <varname>BUILD_DEPENDS</varname>
            definition:</para>

<programlisting>
    BUILD_DEPENDS+= autoconf-2.13:../../devel/autoconf
</programlisting>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>

	<para>If your package needs a library with which to link and
	again there is no <filename>buildlink3.mk</filename> file
        available, this is specified using the
        <varname>DEPENDS</varname> definition. For example:</para>

<programlisting>
    DEPENDS+=       xpm-3.4j:../../graphics/xpm
</programlisting>

          <para>You can also use wildcards in package dependences:</para>

<programlisting>
    DEPENDS+=       xpm-[0-9]*:../../graphics/xpm
</programlisting>

          <para>Note that such wildcard dependencies are retained when
            creating binary packages.  The dependency is checked when
            installing the binary package and any package which matches
            the pattern will be used.  Wildcard dependencies should be
            used with care.</para>

          <para>The <quote>-[0-9]*</quote> should be used instead of
            <quote>-*</quote> to avoid potentially ambiguous matches
            such as <quote>tk-postgresql</quote> matching a
            <quote>tk-*</quote> <varname>DEPENDS</varname>.</para>

          <para>Wildcards can also be used to specify that a package
            will only  build against a certain minimum version of a
            pre-requisite:</para>

<programlisting>
    DEPENDS+=       tiff>=3.5.4:../../graphics/tiff
</programlisting>

          <para>This means that the package will build against version
            3.5.4 of the tiff library or newer.  Such a dependency may
            be warranted if, for example, the API of the library has
            changed with version 3.5.4 and a package would not compile
            against an earlier version of tiff.</para>

          <para>Please note that such dependencies should only be
            updated if a package requires  a newer pre-requisite, but
            not to denote recommendations such as 
            ABI changes that do not prevent a package from building
            correctly.  Such recommendations can be expressed using
            <varname>ABI_DEPENDS</varname>:</para>

<programlisting>
    ABI_DEPENDS+=   tiff>=3.6.1:../../graphics/tiff
</programlisting>

          <para>In addition to the above <varname>DEPENDS</varname>
            line, this denotes that while a package will build against
            tiff&gt;=3.5.4, at least version 3.6.1 is recommended.
            <varname>ABI_DEPENDS</varname> entries will be turned into
            dependencies unless explicitly ignored (in which case a
            warning will be printed).</para>

          <para>To ignore these ABI dependency recommendations and just
            use the required <varname>DEPENDS</varname>, set
            <varname>USE_ABI_DEPENDS=NO</varname>.   This may make
            it easier and faster to update packages built using pkgsrc,
            since older compatible dependencies can continue to be
            used. This is useful for people who watch their rebuilds
            very carefully; it is not very good as a general-purpose
            hammer.  If you use it, you need to be mindful of possible
            ABI changes, including those from the underlying OS.
</para>

	  <para>Packages that are built with recommendations ignored
            may not be uploaded to ftp.NetBSD.org by developers and
            should not be used across different systems that may have
            different versions of binary packages installed.</para>

      <para>Please also note the <varname>BUILD_USES_MSGFMT</varname>
        and <varname>BUILD_USES_GETTEXT_M4</varname> definitions, which

        whether &man.msgfmt.1; is part of the base system, and, if it isn't,
        installs the <filename role="pkg">devel/gettext</filename> package.
	The latter adds a build dependency on either an installed

    <sect2 id="bumping-pkgrevision">
      <title>How to handle incrementing versions when fixing an existing package</title>

      <para>When making fixes to an existing package it can be useful
        to change the version number in <varname>PKGNAME</varname>. To
        avoid conflicting with future versions by the original author, a
        <quote>nb1</quote>, <quote>nb2</quote>, ... suffix can be used
        on package versions by setting <varname>PKGREVISION=1</varname>
        (2, ...). The <quote>nb</quote> is treated like a
        <quote>.</quote> by the pkg tools. e.g.</para>

<programlisting>
    DISTNAME=       foo-17.42
    PKGREVISION=    9
</programlisting>

      <para>will result in a <varname>PKGNAME</varname> of
        <quote>foo-17.42nb9</quote>.</para>

      <para>When a new release of the package is released, the
        <varname>PKGREVISION</varname> should be removed, e.g. on a new
        minor release of the above package, things should be like:</para>

<programlisting>
    DISTNAME=       foo-17.43
</programlisting>

    <para>PKGREVISION should be incremented for any non-trivial change in the
    resulting binary package.  Without a PKGREVISION bump, someone with
    the previous version installed has no way of knowing that their
    package is out of date.  Thus, changes without increasing PKGREVISION

<title>Substituting variable text in the package files (the SUBST framework)</title>

	<para>When you want to replace the same text in multiple files
	or when the replacement text varies, patches alone cannot help.
	This is where the SUBST framework comes in. It provides an
	easy-to-use interface for replacing text in files.
	Example:</para>

<programlisting>
    SUBST_CLASSES+=                 fix-paths
    SUBST_STAGE.fix-paths=          pre-configure
    SUBST_MESSAGE.fix-paths=        Fixing absolute paths.
    SUBST_FILES.fix-paths=          src/*.c
    SUBST_FILES.fix-paths+=         scripts/*.sh
    SUBST_SED.fix-paths=            -e 's,"/usr/local,"${PREFIX},g'
    SUBST_SED.fix-paths+=           -e 's,"/var/log,"${VARBASE}/log,g'
</programlisting>

	<para><varname>SUBST_CLASSES</varname> is a list of identifiers
	that are used to identify the different SUBST blocks that are
	defined. The SUBST framework is heavily used by pkgsrc, so it is
	important to always use the <literal>+=</literal> operator with
	this variable. Otherwise some substitutions may be
	skipped.</para>

	<para>The remaining variables of each SUBST block are
	parameterized with the identifier from the first line
	(<literal>fix-paths</literal> in this case.) They can be seen as
	parameters to a function call.</para>

	<para><varname>SUBST_STAGE.*</varname> specifies the stage at
	which the replacement will take place. All combinations of
	<literal>pre-</literal>, <literal>do-</literal> and
	<literal>post-</literal> together with a phase name are
	possible, though only few are actually used. Most commonly used
	are <literal>post-patch</literal> and
	<literal>pre-configure</literal>. Of these two,
	<literal>pre-configure</literal> should be preferred because
	then it is possible to run <command>bmake patch</command> and
	have the state after applying the patches but before making any
	other changes. This is especially useful when you are debugging
	a package in order to create new patches for it. Similarly,
	<literal>post-build</literal> is preferred over
	<literal>pre-install</literal>, because the install phase should
	generally be kept as simple as possible. When you use
	<literal>post-build</literal>, you have the same files in the
	working directory that will be installed later, so you can check
	if the substitution has succeeded.</para>

	<para><varname>SUBST_MESSAGE.*</varname> is an optional text
	that is printed just before the substitution is done.</para>

	<para><varname>SUBST_FILES.*</varname> is the list of shell
	globbing patterns that specifies the files in which the
	substitution will take place. The patterns are interpreted
	relatively to the <varname>WRKSRC</varname> directory.</para>

	<para><varname>SUBST_SED.*</varname> is a list of arguments to
	&man.sed.1; that specify the actual substitution. Every sed
	command should be prefixed with <literal>-e</literal>, so that
	all SUBST blocks look uniform.</para>

	<para>There are some more variables, but they are so seldomly
	used that they are only documented in the
	<filename>mk/subst.mk</filename> file.</para>

      <title>How to handle modified distfiles with the 'old' name</title>

      <para>Sometimes authors of a software package make some
        modifications after the software was released, and they put up a
        new distfile without changing the package's version number. If a
        package is already in pkgsrc at that time, the checksum will
        no longer match. The contents of the new distfile should be
	compared against the old one before changing anything, to make
	sure the distfile was really updated on purpose, and that
        no trojan horse or so crept in.
	Then, the correct way to work around this is to
	set <varname>DIST_SUBDIR</varname> to a unique directory name,
	usually based on <varname>PKGNAME_NOREV</varname>. In case this
	happens more often, <varname>PKGNAME</varname> can be used (thus
	including the <filename>nbX</filename> suffix) or a date stamp
	can be appended, like <varname>${PKGNAME_NOREV}-YYYYMMDD</varname>.
	Do not forget regenerating the <filename>distinfo</filename> file
	after that, since it contains the <varname>DIST_SUBDIR</varname>
	path in the filenames.
        Furthermore, a mail to the package's authors seems appropriate
	telling them that changing distfiles after releases without
	changing the file names is not good practice.</para>

      <para>pkgsrc supports many different machines, with different

        shared library and dynamic loading at all. To accompany this,
        varying commands and options have to be passed to the
        compiler, linker, etc. to get the Right Thing, which can be

        can help here, as it just <quote>knows</quote> how to build
        both static and dynamic libraries from a set of source files,
        thus being platform-independent.</para>

      <para>Here's how to use libtool in a pkg in seven simple
        steps:</para>

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Add <varname>USE_LIBTOOL=yes</varname> to the package

          <para>For library objects, use <quote>${LIBTOOL} --mode=compile
            ${CC}</quote> in place of <quote>${CC}</quote>. You could even
            add it to the definition of <varname>CC</varname>, if only
            libraries are being built in a given Makefile. This one command
            will build both PIC and non-PIC library objects, so you need not
            have separate shared and non-shared library rules.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>For the linking of the library, remove any
            <quote>ar</quote>, <quote>ranlib</quote>, and <quote>ld

<programlisting>
    ${LIBTOOL} --mode=link ${CC} -o ${.TARGET:.a=.la} ${OBJS:.o=.lo} \
        -rpath ${PREFIX}/lib -version-info major:minor
</programlisting>

          <para>Note that the library is changed to have a
            <filename>.la</filename> extension, and the objects are
            changed to have a <filename>.lo</filename>
            extension. Change <varname>OBJS</varname> as
            necessary. This automatically creates all of the
            <filename>.a</filename>,
            <filename>.so.major.minor</filename>, and ELF symlinks (if
            necessary) in the build directory. Be sure to include
            <quote>-version-info</quote>, especially when major and
            minor are zero, as libtool will otherwise strip off the
            shared library version.</para>

          <para>From the libtool manual:</para>

<programlisting>
    So, libtool library versions are described by three integers:

    CURRENT
        The most recent interface number that this library implements.

    REVISION
        The implementation number of the CURRENT interface.

    AGE
        The difference between the newest and oldest interfaces that
        this library implements.  In other words, the library implements
        all the interface numbers in the range from number `CURRENT -
        AGE' to `CURRENT'.

    If two libraries have identical CURRENT and AGE numbers, then the
    dynamic linker chooses the library with the greater REVISION number.
</programlisting>

          <para>The <quote>-release</quote> option will produce
            different results for a.out and ELF (excluding symlinks)
            in only one case. An ELF library of the form
            <quote>libfoo-release.so.<emphasis>x</emphasis>.<emphasis>y</emphasis></quote>
            will have a symlink of
            <quote>libfoo.so.<emphasis>x</emphasis>.<emphasis>y</emphasis></quote>
            on an a.out platform. This is handled

<title>Creating needed directories</title>

	<para>The BSD-compatible <command>install</command> supplied
	with some operating systems cannot create more than one
	directory at a time. As such, you should call
	<literal>${INSTALL_*_DIR}</literal> like this:</para>

    ${INSTALL_DATA_DIR} ${PREFIX}/dir1
    ${INSTALL_DATA_DIR} ${PREFIX}/dir2
</programlisting>

	<para>You can also just append <quote><literal>dir1

<title>Where to install documentation</title>

	<para>In general, documentation should be installed into
	<filename>${PREFIX}/share/doc/${PKGBASE}</filename> or
	<filename>${PREFIX}/share/doc/${PKGNAME}</filename> (the
	latter includes the version number of the package).</para>

	<para>Many modern packages using GNU autoconf allow to set the
	directory where HTML documentation is installed with the
	<quote>--with-html-dir</quote> option. Sometimes using this
	flag is needed because otherwise the documentation ends up in
	<filename>${PREFIX}/share/doc/html</filename> or other
	places.</para>

	<para>An exception to the above is that library API
	documentation generated with the <filename
	role="pkg">textproc/gtk-doc</filename> tools, for use by
	special browsers (devhelp) should be left at their default
	location, which is
	<filename>${PREFIX}/share/gtk-doc</filename>.  Such
	documentation can be recognized from files ending in
	<filename>.devhelp</filename> or
	<filename>.devhelp2</filename>.  (It is also acceptable to
	install such files in
	<filename>${PREFIX}/share/doc/${PKGBASE}</filename> or
	<filename>${PREFIX}/share/doc/${PKGNAME}</filename>; the
	<filename>.devhelp*</filename> file must be directly in that
	directory then, no additional
	subdirectory level is allowed in this case. This is usually
	achieved by using
	<quote>--with-html-dir=${PREFIX}/share/doc</quote>.
	<filename>${PREFIX}/share/gtk-doc</filename> is preferred
	though.)</para>

      <para>Certain packages, most of them in the games category, install
        a score file that allows all users on the system to record their
        highscores.  In order for this to work, the binaries need to be
        installed setgid and the score files owned by the appropriate
        group and/or owner (traditionally the "games" user/group).  The
        following variables, documented in more detail in

        disabled;  setting <varname>SETGIDGAME=YES</varname> will set all

      <para>The build and installation process of the software provided
