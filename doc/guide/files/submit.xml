<title>Submitting binary packages</title>

	<para>Our policy is that we accept binaries only from pkgsrc
	developers to guarantee that the packages don't contain any
	trojan horses etc. This is not to annoy anyone but rather to
	protect our users! You're still free to put up your home-made
	binary packages and tell the world where to get them. NetBSD
	developers doing bulk builds and wanting to upload them please
	see <xref linkend="bulk-upload"/>.</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="submitting-your-package">
<title>Submitting source packages (for non-NetBSD-developers)</title>

	<para>First, check that your package is complete, compiles and
	runs well; see <xref linkend="debug"/> and the rest of this
	document. Next, generate an uuencoded gzipped &man.tar.1;
	archive that contains all files that make up the package.
	Finally, send this package to the pkgsrc bug tracking system,
	either with the &man.send-pr.1; command, or if you don't have
	that, go to the web page
	<ulink url="http://www.NetBSD.org/Misc/send-pr.html"/>,
	which contains some instructions and a link to a form, where you
	can submit packages.</para>

	<para>In the form of the problem report, the category should be
	<quote>pkg</quote>, the synopsis should include the package name
	and version number, and the description field should contain a
	short description of your package (contents of the COMMENT
	variable or DESCR file are OK). The uuencoded package data should
	go into the <quote>fix</quote> field.</para>

	<para>If you want to submit several packages, please send a
	separate PR for each one, it's easier for us to track things
	that way.</para>

	<para>Alternatively, you can also import new packages into
	pkgsrc-wip (<quote>pkgsrc work-in-progress</quote>); see the
	homepage at <ulink url="http://pkgsrc-wip.sourceforge.net/"/>
	for details.</para>

<sect1 id="general-notes-for-changes">
<title>General notes when adding, updating, or removing packages</title>

	<para>Please note all package additions, updates, moves, and
	removals in <filename>pkgsrc/doc/CHANGES</filename>. It's very
	important to keep this file up to date and conforming to the
	existing format, because it will be used by scripts to
	automatically update pages on <ulink
	url="http://www.NetBSD.org/">www.NetBSD.org</ulink> and other
	sites. Additionally, check the
	<filename>pkgsrc/doc/TODO</filename> file and remove the entry
	for the package you updated or removed, in case it was mentioned
	there.</para>

	<para>When the <varname>PKGREVISION</varname> of a package is
	bumped, the change should appear in
	<filename>pkgsrc/doc/CHANGES</filename> if it is security
	related or otherwise relevant. Mass bumps that result from a
	dependency being updated should not be mentioned. In all other
	cases it's the developer's decision.</para>

<para>There is a make target that helps in creating proper
  <filename>CHANGES</filename> entries:  <command>make
  changes-entry</command>. It uses the optional <varname>CTYPE</varname>
  and <varname>NETBSD_LOGIN_NAME</varname> variables. The general
  usage is to first make sure that your <filename>CHANGES</filename>
  file is up-to-date (to avoid having to resolve conflicts later-on)
  and then to <command>cd</command> to the package directory.  For
  package updates, <command>make changes-entry</command> is enough.
  For new packages, or package moves or removals, set the
  <varname>CTYPE</varname> variable on the command line to "Added",
  "Moved", or "Removed".  You can set <varname>NETBSD_LOGIN_NAME</varname>
  in <filename>/etc/mk.conf</filename> if your local login name is
  not the same as your NetBSD login name. Don't forget to commit
  the changes to <filename>pkgsrc/doc/CHANGES</filename>!</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="committing-importing">
<title>Committing: Importing a package into CVS</title>
<para>This section is only of interest for pkgsrc developers with write
  access to the pkgsrc repository. Please remember that cvs
  imports files relative to the current working directory, and that
  the pathname that you
  give the <command>cvs import</command> command is so that it knows where
  to place the files in the repository.  Newly created packages should be
  imported with a vendor tag of <quote>TNF</quote> and a release tag of
  <quote>pkgsrc-base</quote>, e.g:</para>

<programlisting>
    &uprompt; cd .../pkgsrc/category/pkgname
    &uprompt; cvs import pkgsrc/category/pkgname TNF pkgsrc-base
</programlisting>

<para>Remember to move the directory from which you imported out of
  the way, or cvs will complain the next time you <quote>cvs
  update</quote> your source tree.  Also don't forget to add the new
  package to the category's <filename>Makefile</filename>.</para>

<para>The commit message of the initial import should include part of the
  <filename>DESCR</filename> file, so people reading the mailing lists know
  what the package is/does.</para>

<para>For new packages, <quote>cvs import</quote> is preferred to <quote>cvs
  add</quote> because the former gets everything with a single command,
  and provides a consistent tag.</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="updating-package">
<title>Updating a package to a newer version</title>
<para>Please always put a concise, appropriate and relevant summary of the
  changes between old and new versions into the commit log when updating
  a package. There are various reasons for this:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>A URL is volatile, and can change over time. It may go away completely
  or its information may be overwritten by newer information.</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>Having the change information between old and new versions in our CVS
  repository is very useful for people who use either cvs or anoncvs.</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>Having the change information between old and new versions in our CVS
  repository is very useful for people who read the pkgsrc-changes mailing
  list, so that they can make tactical decisions about when to upgrade
  the package.</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>Please also recognize that, just because a new version of a package
  has been released, it should not automatically be upgraded in the CVS
  repository.  We prefer to be conservative in the packages that are
  included in pkgsrc - development or beta packages are not really the
  best thing for most places in which pkgsrc is used. Please use your
  judgement about what should go into pkgsrc, and bear in mind that
  stability is to be preferred above new and possibly untested features.</para>
