# $NetBSD: eol-packages,v 1.1 2023/09/29 09:13:27 wiz Exp $
#
#FORMAT 1.0.0
#

# This file is designed to allow for a description of any end-of-life
# (eol) packages in the pkgsrc collection.  eol means that there is no
# longer an upstream that is producing maintenance releases, and thus
# that one cannot expect that security bugs will be fixed.
#
# When a package has reached eol an entry should be added to
# pkg-vulnerabilities in the standard format but with a custom "type
# of exploit" and "URL" fields e.g.:
#
#
# foo-[0-9]*	eol	ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/packages/vulns/eol-packages
#
# When `pkg_admin audit' is run it will display a warning in the form of:
#
# Package foo has reached end-of-life (eol), see ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/packages/vulns/eol-packages
#
# Entries in this file have the following fields:
#
#  - Package: package(s) declared EOL/unmaintained by upstream
#  - eol date: if upstream makes an announcement that they are no
#      longer maintaining the software, then either the day after
#      support ends, or the announcement date if no date is given.  If
#      pkgsrc decides (in hindsight) that maintenance has stopped
#      because it has been excessively long since a release, the date
#      should be the date that the entry is added.
#  - URL: reference to EOL announcement by upstream, or announcement
#      by a third party of a fork due to non-support by upstream, or
#      other affirmative data that upstream is no longer maintaining
#      this package.  In cases where there is merely a lack of a new
#      release, leave this field blank.
#  - Description: Short description/rationale of EOL entry and
#      possible information about current supported versions or
#      packages that can be used as replacements for the EOL package.
#      The primary purpose of this file is to record that an upstream
#      is no longer maintaining a package; there is no need to give
#      advice about what users should do.
#
# If you have comments/additions/corrections, please contact
# pkgsrc-security@NetBSD.org.
