These are some notes on how to make your package cross-compilable.
There is no single recipe for it -- each package is different, and
even if it follows, say, the GNU build system conventions, it may have
its quirks, and the author of the software you're packaging may not
have ever thought of cross-compilation.

* Native and target platform

When building a package, MACHINE_ARCH, OPSYS, &c., describe the
platform for which the package is being built.  If
USE_CROSS_COMPILE=no, this is the native platform; otherwise, if
USE_CROSS_COMPILE=yes, it is the target platform.  The additional
variables NATIVE_MACHINE_ARCH, NATIVE_OPSYS, &c., always describe the
native platform.

When building a native package for cross-compilation, such as a
compiler for the target, the variables TARGET_MACHINE_ARCH,
TARGET_OPSYS, &c., describe the target platform.  If the build product
varies with the choice of target, then TARGET_MACHINE_ARCH or
TARGET_OPSYS or whatever affects it should be embedded into the PKGNAME
somewhere so that the different build products are distinguished by
having different package names.

XXX Missing:
XXX - TARGET_MACHINE_GNU_PLATFORM
XXX - TARGET_MACHINE_GNU_ARCH
XXX - probably other variables defined in terms of the CROSSVARS

* Specifying the toolchain

The following build systems should automagically handle
cross-compilation by passing through the architecture and OS
information:

- GNU_CONFIGURE=yes
- .include "../../devel/meson/build.mk" (sets
- .include "../../devel/cmake/build.mk" (and legacy USE_CMAKE=yes)

Additional tweaks are sometimes needed (but not always), conditional on
${USE_CROSS_COMPILE:tl} == "yes" (after including bsd.prefs.mk):

- (pkg-config) ALL_ENV+= PKG_CONFIG_SYSROOT_DIR=${CROSS_DESTDIR:Q}
- (pkg-config) ALL_ENV+= PKG_CONFIG_FDO_SYSROOT_RULES=1
- (cmake) CMAKE_CONFIGURE_ARGS+= -DCMAKE_SYSROOT:STRING=${CROSS_DESTDIR:Q}

* Tool dependencies

If the process of building your package requires running programs,
loading libraries, using data, &c., from a native package, the native
package is a tool dependency, not (necessarily) a build dependency or
a normal dependency.  For example, if building your package entails
transforming some XML with XSLT, you might add:

TOOL_DEPENDS+=  libxslt>=1.1.0:../../textproc/libxslt

If you need to refer to the full pathname of a file in a package
installed with TOOL_DEPENDS, it will generally be relative to TOOLBASE
rather than LOCALBASE.  For example:

XSLTPROC=	${TOOLBASE}/bin/xsltproc

post-build:
	cd ${WRKSRC}/xmlstuff && ${XSLTPROC} ...

* Native C and C++ compilers

Some software wants build tools written in C and C++ and then execute
them natively at build-time.  Your package probably does this if when
you try to cross-compile it, it fails with:

   sh: Cannot execute ELF binary ./foobar

Sometimes configure scripts or makefiles accept a variable named
CC_FOR_BUILD or similar to build these tools.  In that case, you can
pass in the pkgsrc make variables NATIVE_CC and friends:

.include "../../mk/bsd.prefs.mk"

.if ${USE_CROSS_COMPILE:U:tl} == "yes"
CONFIGURE_ENV+= CC_FOR_BUILD=${NATIVE_CC:Q}
CONFIGURE_ENV+= CXX_FOR_BUILD=${NATIVE_CXX:Q}
CONFIGURE_ENV+= LD_FOR_BUILD=${NATIVE_LD:Q}
.endif

If the software doesn't use CC_FOR_BUILD, it may still be easy to find
the makefile rules that invoke $(CC) or $(LD) to build native tools
and patch them to replace that by $(CC_FOR_BUILD) and $(LD_FOR_BUILD).

XXX The mechanism here is currently pretty kludgey; there is little
principle to these NATIVE_CC/CXX/LD variables and they should be
better rationalized.  If you want a native Fortran compiler, for
instance, you'll have to hack it yourself.

* Configure-time run-tests

There's a lot of autoconf-configured software out there that uses
run-tests to learn about the environment, which doesn't work so well
in cross-builds.  Your package probably uses this if it when you try to
cross-compile it, it fails with:

   configure: error: cannot run test programs while cross-compiling

or

   configure: error: cannot check for file existence when cross-compiling

Some of these can be patched to be replaced by compile-tests.
Otherwise, for a particular known target environment, you can
pre-answer the tests for autoconf:

.include "../../bsd.prefs.mk"

.if ${USE_CROSS_COMPILE:tl} == "yes"
# Configure wants to check for /dev/random but can't.  We know NetBSD
# always has a /dev/random, so inform autoconf of the fact.
CONFIGURE_ENV.NetBSD+=	ac_cv_file__dev_random=yes
.endif
