Changes to the pkgsrc-1-6-1 branch:

mk/texinfo.mk					1.9

	[abs]

mail/imap-uw/Makefile				1.54

Linux cp -R behaves differently to NetBSD when given a directory as a source
argument. Handle differently.
	[abs]

devel/opencm/distinfo				1.6
devel/opencm/patches/patch-aa			1.3

Unset GZIP from the environment before calling GZIP_CMD.  Should fix problems
shown in Hubert's bulk build.  Thanks to Yuji Yamano!

sysutils/gnome-vfs/Makefile			1.26
devel/bonobo/Makefile				1.35

graphics/avifile-devel/buildlink2.mk		1.4

graphics/avifile-devel/patches/patch-ac		1.3 (new)

Add suitable arguments to "avifile-config --libs" for autodetected XFree 4
static libraries, where required. [You can't have a shared library run-time
dependency on a static library.] This may let "apla" build again on systems
with XFree 4 -- not tested.
	[fredb]

graphics/apla/Makefile				1.14

This builds again on NetBSD 1.6.1, but only against the latest version
of avifile-devel. Bump pkgrevision.
	[fredb]

mk/bulk/bsd.bulk-pkg.mk				1.43

correct the 'broken due to depends' processing.  This change makes the
summary email list correctly the packages which are broken because of
their dependencies.  Problem noted on Huberts most recent bulk build.

correct #ifdef misplacement.

x11/kdebase3/distinfo				1.19

a bad (for 64 bit systems) prototype.
	[dmcmahill]

unlimit datasize to allow this to build on alpha
	[dmcmahill]

Automate the creation of /emul/linux/etc/mtab:
Use the code from Johnny (jlam) again, but do an additional copy at
pre-install, because the file has to be present during do-install already.
