PKGSRC NEWS
===========

  This file contains information about important infrastructural changes in
  pkgsrc. The intended readers are the pkgsrc developers as well as anyone
  tracking pkgsrc-current.

PKGSRC_USE_MKTOOLS support added [jperkin 2022-06-07]

        Added C-based tools to speed up various parts of the
        mk infrastructure via PKGSRC_USE_MKTOOLS=yes in mk.conf.

        For packages with large numbers of dependencies, you should see
        anywhere up to around 10x speed-up for the 'wrapper' phase, and
        perhaps more importantly a huge reduction in system time usage.

Linux infrastructure adapted to non-standard distributions [nia 2022-05-01]

        The Linux pkgsrc infrastructure was adapted to support Linux
        distributions where binaries and shared objects are not
        stored in a normal Unix-like file system layout.  It's hoped
        that this will be useful for pkgsrc development on platforms
        like NixOS and Gobo Linux.

UnixWare support [nia 2021-12-26]

        Support for SCO/Xinuos UnixWare support was improved to the
        point where it is possible to complete a bootstrap on this
        platform.

SHA1 distfile hashes deprecated [nia 2021-10-07]

        Distfile hash algorithms have been changed, keeping SHA512,
        adding BLAKE2s, and removing SHA1 and RMD160.  New packages
        and updates will only generate SHA512 and BLAKE2s, and the
        stored hashes have been adjusted.

Default Python version changed to 3.9 [nia 2021-10-01]

Increased enabled-by-default hardening options [nia 2021-09-27]

	PKGSRC_USE_MKPIE was enabled on some architectures.
	Packages that provide static libraries to other packages
	should be rebuilt with MKPIE enabled.
	Some packages may experience runtime errors on platforms
	like i386 - usually this is due to unsafe assembly code,
	which should be disabled when MKPIE is enabled.

	PKGSRC_USE_SSP was bumped from "yes" to "strong".  This
	is not expected to have a noticable effect.

	More information:
	https://www.NetBSD.org/docs/pkgsrc/hardening.html
	(or see "Security hardening" section of doc/pkgsrc.txt)

Default MySQL implementation changed to MariaDB 10.6 [nia 2021-09-27]

Default PostgreSQL changed to 13 [nia 2021-06-28]

Default MySQL implementation changed to MariaDB [nia 2021-06-24]

	The default version of MySQL as set by the pkgsrc infrastructure
	was changed from MySQL 5.7 to MariaDB 10.5.

	This is configurable by setting MYSQL_VERSION_DEFAULT in mk.conf.

	PHP packages are no longer tied to a specific MySQL version
	due to the native driver being enabled by default.

Python 3.8 default [nia 2020-12-04]
	The default Python version was switched to 3.8.

Default database location changed for NetBSD [wiz 2020-12-02]
	The database of installed packages now defaults to ${PREFIX}/pkgdb
	instead of /var/db/pkg on NetBSD. This matches the default on
	other operating systems and cases where a non-default bootstrap
	is used.

	To deal with this change, see this blog post:

	https://pkgsrc.org/news/pkgdb-change/

	Since this change affects the packaging tools only, there is no change
	to binary packages and they do not need to be rebuilt.

lua 5.3 default [nia 2020-03-30]
	The default Lua version was switched to 5.3.
	Since many packages specify a preferred Lua version, this is mainly
	expected to affect users of Lua modules who were using the default
	settings.

gfortran default [nia 2020-03-30]
	gfortran is now the default Fortran compiler instead of g95.
	gfortran is expected to support more pkgsrc platforms and be
	better at compiling newer Fortran code.

python 3.7 default [maya 2019-04-24]
	As Python 2.x versions are nearing end of life, we have switched
	the default to a newer version.
	Python 2.7 packages are still available, and most python packages
	are built for all available python versions.

Lua multiversion support [alnsn 2014-05-03]
	Lua packages lang/lua51 and lang/lua52 have been modified
	to coexist without conflicts, infrastructure for supporting
	multiple versions of Lua has been put in place and all
	dependent packages have been adapted to the new infrastructure.

SMF support is introduced [jperkin 2014-03-11]

Unprivileged staged installation is default [asau 2012-08-14]
	pkgsrc has changed to use unprivileged staged installation by default.
	This makes it possible to prevent some installation mistakes.
	It also makes detection of package conflicts easier.
	Previously you had to set PKG_DESTDIR_SUPPORT to "user-destdir"
	to invoke this functionality. Set PKG_DESTDIR_SUPPORT to "none"
	to revert to direct installation.

buildlink3.mk layout changed [joerg 2009-03-20]
	The buildlink3.mk files have been reorganized to reduce
	redundant parsing for deeply nested buildlink3 trees.
	The createbuildlink package has been updated to create
	the new format.

PLIST_VARS introduced [jlam 20080413]
	PLIST_VARS is a simpler way to do conditional PLIST entries.
	The old method of doing e.g. PLIST_SUBST+= FOO="@comment " can
	now be done by unconditionally setting PLIST_VARS+=foo and
	conditionally setting PLIST.foo=yes. This will result in substitution
	of ${PLIST.foo} in the PLIST with either "" or "@comment ".

SKIP_PORTABILITY_CHECK is obsolete [rillig 20080220]
	After being deprecated for about 16 months, this early misdesign
	has finally been obsoleted and removed from pkgsrc.

Check for stripped/unstripped binaries [rillig 20080213]
	A new check has been added in mk/check/check-stripped.mk to
	assure that the installed binaries conform to the setting of the
	INSTALL_UNSTRIPPED variable. It is not enabled by default due to
	lack of testing.

OpenSSL update [tnn 20080118]
	OpenSSL in pkgsrc switched from the 0.9.7 to the 0.9.8 branch. To
	accommodate for this, 596 packages dependent on openssl had their
	revisions bumped.

pkgsrc-2007Q4 released [agc 20080105]
	A new stable branch was released. Read the announcement at:
	http://mail-index.netbsd.org/netbsd-announce/2008/01/05/0000.html

Simplifying meta-packages [rillig 20071219]
	The variable META_PACKAGE was introduced. This simplifies creation
	and maintenance of packages that do not install files.

Replace a package with different name [gdt 20071107]
	The variable OLDNAME was introduced for "make replace" to
	replace a package with a name other than the new one, via
	"make replace OLDNAME=oldpkgname".  Read the announcement at:
	http://mail-index.netbsd.org/tech-pkg/2007/11/07/0002.html
	
pkgsrc-2007Q3 released [agc 20071015]
	A new stable branch was released. Read the announcement at:
	http://mail-index.netbsd.org/netbsd-announce/2007/10/15/0000.html

Features framework [jlam 20070907]
	A "system features" framework has been added. It will be used to
	automatically supply missing "basic" headers and libraries for old
	systems. This is supported through the USE_FEATURES variable.

X.org 6.9 removed [joerg 20070817]
	monolithic X.org 6.9 was removed from pkgsrc. It was obsoleted by the
	modular X.org (7.x) packages. Transitioning users should remove all old
	X.org packages and set X11_TYPE=modular in mk.conf.

Emulator framework [jlam 20070729]
	A new emulator framework has been added. This will handle all
	binary-only packages that require emulation on the native OS.
	Please see pkgsrc/mk/emulator/README.

audit-packages merged with pkg_install [adrianp 20070714]
	The utility for auditing installed packages for security problems,
	audit-packages, has been rewritten in C. It is now part of the
	pkgtools/pkg_install package.
	
pkgsrc-2007Q2 released [agc 20070701]
	A new stable branch was released. Read the announcement at:
	http://mail-index.netbsd.org/netbsd-announce/2007/07/01/0000.html
