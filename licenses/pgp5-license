PGP International Freeware, Version 5.0 (Source Code Version)
Copyright (c) 1990-1997 Pretty Good Privacy, Inc.  All Rights Reserved.

For Non-Commercial Distribution and Use Only
Terms and Conditions

	
This special freeware version of the source code ("Source Code Package") of 
PGP 5.0 ("Software Product"), including the software, its source code, and 
its related user and development documentation, is owned by Pretty Good 
Privacy, Inc. (or "PGP") and is protected by copyright laws and international 
copyright treaties, as well as other intellectual property laws and treaties.

The makers of PGP, however, are committed to making freely available to 
individuals around the world a trusted means to secure their personal 
information and communications from unwanted invasions of privacy. In keeping 
with the traditions of PGP, the source code of PGP 5.0 has been published for 
the purpose of facilitating peer review. Pretty Good Privacy, Inc. published 
the source code in a set of printed books; a printed book or other printed 
material setting forth encryption source code is not itself subject to the 
U.S. export regulations (see U.S. EAR Sec. 734.3(b)(2)). The scanning in and 
review of the source code by independent cryptographers, unrelated to PGP, 
assures that the cryptography employed in the PGP software may be trusted -- 
i.e., it is truly strong and that the software contains no hidden back doors 
allowing third party access to encrypted messages. In addition, it is 
important that the Software Product be available in as many languages, 
operate on as many operating system and hardware platforms, and be as solid 
and secure as possible. 

To facilitate these important goals, the makers of PGP have agreed, subject 
to all of the terms and conditions which follow, that it will not assert any 
copyright claims against certain uses of the Source Code Package by users who 
wish to freely contribute to the efforts of PGP, as specifically described 
below. The rights granted in this license apply only to source code that was 
obtained directly from a printed book or other printed materials published by 
Pretty Good Privacy, Inc.

1.  Non-Commercial Licenses

  a.  Non-Commercial Use.  You may use this Source Code Package solely for the 
non-commercial purposes permitted below. The term "non-commercial" means that 
the package (a) has been distributed or otherwise made available at no charge 
(direct or indirect) and (b) is not used for any commercial purpose, which 
includes, but is not limited to, any activity engaged for the purpose of 
generating revenues (directly or indirectly).  For example, a commercial 
purpose includes the use of the package within a commercial business or 
facility or the use of the package to provide a service, or in support of 
service, for which you charge. Commercial purpose also includes use by any 
government agency or organization. Examples of non-commercial purposes 
include use at home for personal correspondence, use by students for academic 
activities, or use by human rights organizations. The software is in "use" 
when it is loaded into the temporary memory (i.e., RAM) or installed into the 
permanent memory (e.g., hard disk, CD ROM, or other storage device) of a 
computer for the purpose of being accessible in client-mode by an end user.

  b.  Non-Commercial Distribution.  You may make exact, unmodified copies of 
this Source Code Package and distribute such copies solely by electronic 
means (for example, posting on Internet sites for others to download), 
subject to the following (a) that such distribution is solely for non-
commercial purposes (see above definition), (b) that the Source Code Package 
is distributed unmodified and in its entirety (with its complete user 
documentation, its readme files, its copyright, trademark, other intellectual 
property notices, including these terms and conditions, and all of its other 
components), and (c) that such distribution may occur anywhere in the world, 
except that Pretty Good Privacy, Inc. expressly forbids the export of this 
Source Code Package to any countries embargoed by the U.S. government 
(currently including, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Syria and Sudan) 
or to the United States to the extent the practice in the U.S. of any of the 
inventions covered by U.S. patent no. 4,405,829 (the "RSA" patent) would 
require payment to the patent rights holder.

  c.  User Involvement. Subject to all of the conditions set forth in this 
section, you may use this Source Code Package solely for the following non-
commercial purposes: (a) to review and compile the source code contained in 
the Source Code Package for the purpose of determining the strength and 
trustworthiness of the Software Product, reporting any problems you discover 
to PGP (or its designee) (b) to write bug fixes ("Corrections"), (c) to 
otherwise modify or enhance the source code ("Enhancements"), (d) to port the 
Software Product or its source code to operate on other operating system or 
hardware platforms ("Port"), (e) to write translations or localizations of 
the Software Product or its source code ("Translations"), and (f) to use 
internally and solely for non-commercial purposes (as defined above) a 
compiled version of the source code, including any Corrections, Enhancements, 
Ports, or Translations (collectively, "Derivative Works") you create, 
provided that you do NOT reproduce, electronically post, transmit, or 
otherwise distribute to anyone else any such Derivative Works (see reasons at 
the end of this paragraph). However, you may submit to PGP (or its designee) 
any Derivative Works that you create, but in doing so (a) you represent that, 
if you are not a citizen or permanent resident of the United States or Canada 
or if you are not located in the United States or Canada, you did not receive 
any technical assistance from any employee or representative of PGP in 
connection with the creation of the Derivative Works, (b) you agree that any 
such submission of Derivative Works is a free contribution to PGP and that 
PGP is free to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, transmit, display, 
perform, prepare derivative works thereof, or otherwise make use of or 
exploit such Derivative Works, in any way and by any means now known or 
hereafter devised for as long as PGP wishes, (c) you agree not to assert any 
droit morale you may have with respect to such Derivative Works, and (d) you 
agree that you will remain solely responsible for complying with any local 
laws regarding your use of PGP and the creation of such Derivative Works. 
Because such Derivative Works could have an impact upon the cryptographic 
integrity and strict quality control of PGP, affect compliance with PGP's 
cryptographic algorithms and protocols, or could create interoperability 
issues, compatibility problems and user confusion, PGP will be under no 
obligation to use, distribute or otherwise exploit any such Derivative Works. 
For these same reasons, permission to allow you or others to reproduce and 
distribute any such Derivative Works or any compiled version of the source 
code of this Source Code Package (i.e., anything except the unmodified 
version of the Source Code Package), will generally NOT be given. Most 
important, PGP expressly forbids the creation of any Derivative Works that 
may compromise the privacy or security of the users of the Software Product 
or the Source Code Package.
