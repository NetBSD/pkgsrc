Grant of License Applicable To TeamSpeak for Non-Commercial Entities

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement,
TeamSpeak Systems grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable,
and revocable right to use the freeware version of the Software
solely in accordance with the following terms and conditions:

1. Use of TeamSpeak TeamSpeak is being distributed as Freeware. It
may be freely used, copied and distributed as long as it is not
sold and all original files are included, including this license.
You may download and use both the TeamSpeak Client or Server
applications on as many computers as you require. TeamSpeak servers
are defined as ANY server upon which a connection is allowed -- be
it virtual or physical. You must not exceed a total of 1000 slots
over a maximum of 10 TeamSpeak servers within your organization.
In addition, you must configure each of your servers to run no more
than 100 slots.

2. Non-Profit Organization (NPO) License If your non-commercial
entity hosts TeamSpeak servers 100% free of charge to the open pub
AND your website is free of any advertisements or Paypal donation
buttons, you may be entitled to receive a special NPO license.  In
order to qualify you must meet ALL of the following REQUIREMENTS:
a) You must be a 100% non-profit entity. If we cannot easily
determine this by visiting your website we may require you to
provide us with documented proof.  b) You cannot advertise for any
sort of profit OR for any commercial entity at all on your website.
In addition, and due to abuse, we also don't allow the use of Paypal
buttons anywhere on your site.  c) Your website must be up and
running/active/live so we can visit the site and review its content.
d) Your entity must be large enough to require at least 1000 slots
(regardless of the number of servers).  For further information
please contact sales@tritoncia.com. Please note that a typical
gaming guild or clan hosting a private TeamSpeak server for themselves
(up to 100 slots) OR renting a server from an Authorized TeamSpeak
Host Provider (ATHP) is NOT considered an NPO, will NOT qualify to
receive an NPO license, and must abide by the terms and conditions
set forth in this license agreement.

3. Distribution Permitted You may make copies of your copy of
TeamSpeak to give to others provided that such copies are not
modified from the original downloaded copy of TeamSpeak. You may
not charge a fee for distributing copies of TeamSpeak. If a copy

send TeamSpeak Systems an e-mail addressed to sales@tritoncia.com
notifying TeamSpeak Systems of such distribution and the identity
of the person or entity receiving the copy of TeamSpeak.

4. Termination TeamSpeak Systems may terminate your license for
TeamSpeak at any time, for any reason or no reason. TeamSpeak
Systems may also terminate your license in TeamSpeak if you breach
any of the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. Upon
termination, you shall immediately destroy all copies of TeamSpeak
in your possession, custody or control.

5. Fees There is no license fee for TeamSpeak for Non-Commercial
Entities. If you wish to utilize TeamSpeak within a commercial
environment, you will be required to pay the applicable license
fees (see below).

6. Examples Examples of Non-Commercial Entities include but are
not limited to the following:  a) An individual hosting a single
TeamSpeak server configured to allow up to 100 slots for their
online gaming clan using their home Cable/DSL connection for
non-profit.  b) An individual hosting 10 TeamSpeak servers with
100 slots each but does NOT ask for fees, does not advertise, nor
receives any sort of compensation or benefits for doing so.  c) An

but does NOT ask for fees from clan members AND does NOT rent or
share space with others for profit.  d) A church or other non-profit,
non-commercial organization hosting a free TeamSpeak server for
