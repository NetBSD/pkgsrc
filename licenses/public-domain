This file exists to be the target of

LICENSE=	public-domain

It is pointed to by packages whose contents are not subject to
copyright.  (Note that this file does not actually define a license;
we use this mechanism rather than adding a COPYRIGHTED variable
because public domain files are fairly rare and in such cases the
convenience of LICENSE=public-domain is more important than
pendantry.)
