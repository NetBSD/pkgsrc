                    Products,

               except  that, with  respect to  the  AT&T Patent Claims , the
               license rights granted in  clauses (iii) and (iv) above shall
               only extend,  and be  limited, to that  portion of a  Derived

       2. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you may
          create a hyperlink between an Internet website owned and
          controlled by you and the Website, which hyperlink describes in a
          fair and good faith manner where the Capsule and Source Code may
          be obtained, provided that, you do not frame the Website or
          otherwise give the false impression that AT&T is somehow
          associated with, or otherwise endorses or sponsors your website.
          Any goodwill associated with such hyperlink shall inure to the
          sole benefit of AT&T. Other than the creation of such hyperlink,

          rights or licenses under any of AT&T?s IPR are granted or, by
          implication, estoppel or otherwise, conferred. By way of example

          Section 4.1 may be in electronic form and may be distributed with
          the Build Materials in a form such that the recipient accepts the
          agreement by using or installing the Build Materials. If any
          Additional Code contained in your Build Materials includes
          Software you obtained under license, the agreement shall also
          include complete details concerning the license and any
          restrictions or obligations associated with such Software.

               directed by AT&T; or,

            b. Where you make your Patch generally available on your
               Internet website, you shall provide AT&T with the URL of your
               website and hereby grant to AT&T a non-exclusive, fully-paid
               up right to create a hyperlink between your website and a
               page associated with the Website.

          with the right to sublicense others, to (a) make, have made, use,
          offer to sell, sell and import any products, services or any

       1. The Source Code and Capsule are provided to you "AS IS". YOU

          INCLUDING THE RISK OF ANY DEFECTS OR INACCURACIES THEREIN. AT&T
          DOES NOT MAKE, AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS, ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
          WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
          THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
          PARTICULAR PURPOSE, WARRANTIES OF TITLE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT OF ANY
          IPR OR TRADEMARK RIGHTS, ANY WARRANTIES ARISING BY USAGE OF TRADE,
          COURSE OF DEALING OR COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, OR ANY WARRANTY THAT

          REQUIREMENTS.

          PROGRAMS OR INFORMATION, AND THE LIKE) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF
          OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOURCE CODE OR CAPSULE, EVEN IF AT&T OR
          ANY OF ITS AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVES HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
          POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, (b) ANY CLAIM ATTRIBUTABLE TO ERRORS,
          OMISSIONS, OR OTHER INACCURACIES IN THE SOURCE CODE OR CAPSULE, OR
          (c) ANY CLAIM BY ANY THIRD PARTY.

       3. BECAUSE SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF
          LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, THE ABOVE

          DOES NOT ALLOW THE COMPLETE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
          OF CLAIMS AND DAMAGES AS SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AT&T?S
          LIABILITY IS LIMITED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

  7. INDEMNIFICATION

       1. You shall indemnify and hold harmless AT&T, its affiliates and
          authorized representatives against any claims, suits or
          proceedings asserted or commenced by any third party and arising
          out of, or relating to, your use of the Source Code. This
          obligation shall include indemnifying against all damages, losses,
          costs and expenses (including attorneys? fees) incurred by AT&T,
          its affiliates and authorized representatives as a result of any
          such claims, suits or proceedings, including any costs or expenses
          incurred in defending against any such claims, suits, or
          proceedings.

  8. GENERAL

       1. You shall not assert against AT&T, its affiliates or authorized
          representatives any claim for infringement or misappropriation of
          any IPR or trademark rights in any way relating to the Source
          Code, including any such claims relating to any Patches.

       2. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is deemed
          illegal or unenforceable, AT&T may, but is not obligated to, post
          on the Website a new version of this Agreement which, in AT&T's
          opinion, reasonably preserves the intent of this Agreement.

       3. Your rights and license (but not any of your obligations) under
          this Agreement shall terminate automatically in the event that (a)
          notice of a non-frivolous claim by a third party relating to the
          Source Code or Capsule is posted on the Website, (b) you have
          knowledge of any such claim, (c) any of your representations or
          warranties in Article 1.0 or Section 8.4 are false or inaccurate,
          (d) you exceed the rights and license granted to you or (e) you
          fail to fully comply with any provision of this Agreement. Nothing
          in this provision shall be construed to restrict you, at your
          option and subject to applicable law, from replacing the portion
          of the Source Code that is the subject of a claim by a third party
          with non-infringing code or from independently negotiating for
          necessary rights from the third party.

       4. You acknowledge that the Source Code and Capsule may be subject to
          U.S. export laws and regulations, and, accordingly, you hereby
          assure AT&T that you will not, directly or indirectly, violate any
          applicable U.S. laws and regulations.

       5. Without limiting any of AT&T?s rights under this Agreement or at
          law or in equity, or otherwise expanding the scope of the license
          and rights granted hereunder, if you fail to perform any of your
          obligations under this Agreement with respect to any of your
          Patches or Derived Products, or if you do any act which exceeds
          the scope of the license and rights granted herein, then such
          Patches, Derived Products and acts are not licensed or otherwise
          authorized under this Agreement and such failure shall also be
          deemed a breach of this Agreement. In addition to all other relief
          available to it for any breach of your obligations under this
          Agreement, AT&T shall be entitled to an injunction requiring you
          to perform such obligations.

       6. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance
          with the laws of the State of New York, USA, without regard to its
          conflicts of law rules. This Agreement shall be fairly interpreted
          in accordance with its terms and without any strict construction
          in favor of or against either AT&T or you. Any suit or proceeding
          you bring relating to this Agreement shall be brought and
          prosecuted only in New York, New York, USA.
