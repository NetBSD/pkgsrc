   modified to the extent necessary to conform to applicable law so as to
   give the maximum effect to the intent of the parties. No term or provision
   in the EULA will be considered waived, and no breach excused, unless such
   waiver is in writing signed on behalf of the party against whom the waiver
   is asserted. No waiver (whether express or implied) will constitute
   consent to, waiver of, or excuse of any other, different, or subsequent
   breach. No modifications or amendments to this EULA will be binding upon
   Corel unless made in writing and duly executed by You and an authorized
   representative of Corel.

   party software) may be subject to You explicitly accepting a license
   agreement with that third party. Where such bundled third party software
   includes software from Right Hemisphere, Inc., use of that bundled
   software product is subject to the end user license available at
   http://www.righthemisphere.com/eula, and Your use of that software
