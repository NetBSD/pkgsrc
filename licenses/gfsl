This work may be distributed and/or modified under the conditions
of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.3a of this
license or (at your option) any later version, provided that the
following additional clauses are observed:

1. Due to the nature of fonts, clause 6a of the LaTeX Project Public
   License, version 1.3a, does not apply. A later version of the
   LaTeX Project Public License may number or word this clause
   differently; it is the substance that is important.

   be distributed only after changing the names of the fonts comprising
   this work and given in the accompanying file MANIFEST.txt, and
   that the files comprising the Work, as listed in MANIFEST.txt
