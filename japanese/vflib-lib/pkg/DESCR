VFlib is the Japanese vector font library, supporting TrueType, Zeit,
JG, and BDF fonts.  The Watanabe-vector font is used by default for
mincho(min) and gothic(goth).

You can use your own fonts by installing them (/usr/share/font is
recommended) and adding them to ${PREFIX}/lib/VFlib/vfontcap.

See ${PREFIX}/lib/VFlib/doc/man.ps or the website for more details
(in Japanese).

This port supports the FreeType library.  Freetype makes use of hinting
information in TrueType font files so that clearer output is possible.
To use Freetype with TrueType fonts, simply modify
${PREFIX}/lib/VFlib/vfontcap as follows:

	1.  Change `truetype' to `freetype', then
	2.  Add .ttf or .ttc to the font file path.

For example:

# Before...
r-ricoh-ttw-hg-mincho-l-pro|Ricoh TrueTypeWorld HG Mincho L PRO:\
	:ft=truetype:\
	:ff=/usr/local/lib/dp/font/truetype/hgrmlpsj:

# After...
r-ricoh-ttw-hg-mincho-l-pro|Ricoh TrueTypeWorld HG Mincho L PRO:\
	:ft=freetype:\
	:ff=/usr/local/lib/dp/font/truetype/hgrmlpsj.ttf:
