=============================================================
1. If you customize namazu configuration, copy
   @EXAMPLEDIR@/share/namazu/namazurc.default and
   @EXAMPLEDIR@/mknmzrc.default to @CONFDIR@,
   and edit them.

2. Since index file format is differnet from namazu 1.X, you need to
   rebuild index files if you upgrade from namazu 1.X.

3. In order to processing Japanese, you need to set "LC_ALL", "LANG"
   or "LC_CTYPE" environment to "ja".  Or use --indexing-lang option
   of mknmz.

4. In order to display Japanese message, you need to set "LANGUAGE",
   "LC_ALL", "LC_MESSAGES" or "LANG" environment to "ja".

5. Because of lack of locale support, you need to set "PERL_BADLANG"
   for perl to stop the warning on NetBSD 1.5.X and before.
   On NetBSD current (1.6 or later), you don't need to set
   "PERL_BADLANG" but "LC_LANG" environment.

6. If you want to make index of bellow file type, please install
   appropriate package.
