# Config file for pkgsrc
# ======================
#
# This file is intended to customize the program. Any changes made to this file
# don't create a modified version of the program in terms of the license.
#
# This file will be parsed by a POSIX shell. Therefore all lines starting with
# the character '#' are comments and ignored.


# User configuration
# ==============================================================================
# Installation prefix (must be an absolute path without trailing slash)
# The environment variable 'PREFIX' will override this entry if present!
# The environment variable 'DESTDIR' will be prepended to this entry if present!

# Disable IPv6
# Set this to 1 to disable the usage of IPv6 and POSIX.1g API even if system
# report IPv6 option (IP6) as available
CFG_IP6_DISABLE=@IP6@

# Disable compression
# Set this to 1 if NNTP COMPRESS extension should never be used, even if the
# required libraries (currently libz) are installed and usable.
# Otherwise the compression negotiation can be enabled and disabled in the GUI
# (disabled by default)
CFG_CMPR_DISABLE=0

# Disable X11 double buffering
# DB is slow. On fast machines this can be set to 0 to reduce flicker in the GUI
CFG_DB_DISABLE=@XDBE@

# Disable National Language Support (NLS)
# Set this to 1 to disable NLS even if system report it as available.
CFG_NLS_DISABLE=@NLS@

# The TLS module can do some simple checks and generate warnings if it thinks
# that underlaying libraries contain known security vulnerabilities
# Set this to 1 if you don't want to get such warnings
CFG_TLS_WARNING_DISABLE=1
# ==============================================================================


# Force usage of REQUIRED facilities that system reports as not available
# ==============================================================================
# Force usage of POSIX.1b realtime extension, timers (TMR) option even if system
# reports TMR option as not available
# Set this to 1 if your system report no sufficient TMR option, but you want to
# try anyway
CFG_FORCE_TMR=1

# Force usage of POSIX.1c thread (THR) extension even if system reports THR
# extension as not available
# Set this to 1 if your system report no sufficient THR extension, but you want
# to try anyway

# Force usage of POSIX.2a user portability (UP) utilities even if system reports
# UP extension as not available
# Set this to 1 if your system report no sufficient UP extension, but you want
# to try anyway
CFG_FORCE_UP=1
# ==============================================================================


# Force usage of OPTIONAL facilities that system reports as not available
# ==============================================================================
# Force usage of X/Open System Interface (XSI) even if system reports XSI
# extension as not available or too old (at least SUSv2 is required)
# Set this to 1 if your system report no sufficient XSI extension, but you want
# to try anyway

# Dependency creation (try the defaults if in doubt)
# ==============================================================================
# Commands to create dependencies
# If the compilers preprocessor don't support '-M' use makedepend like this:
