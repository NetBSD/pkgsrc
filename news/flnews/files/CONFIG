# Disable IPv6
# Set this to 1 to disable the usage of IPv6 and POSIX.1g API even if system
# report IPv6 option (IP6) as available
CFG_IP6_DISABLE=@IP6@

# Disable compression
# Set this to 1 if NNTP COMPRESS extension should never be used, even if the
# required libraries (currently libz) are installed and usable.
# Otherwise the compression negotiation can be enabled and disabled in the GUI
# (disabled by default)

# Disable X11 double buffering
# DB is slow. On fast machines this can be set to 0 to reduce flicker in the GUI

# Disable National Language Support (NLS)
# Set this to 1 to disable NLS even if system report it as available.

# The TLS module can do some simple checks and generate warnings if it thinks
# that underlaying libraries contain known security vulnerabilities
# Set this to 1 if you don't want to get such warnings

# The TLS module can use CRLs to check for revoked X.509 certificates
# Usage and update interval can be configured via configfile (see manual page)
# CRLs are downloaded automatically and must be available via HTTP protocol
# (CRL distribution point entries in certificates)
# Note: Not all CAs provide CRL distribution points in their certificates
# Set this to 0 to check the whole chain for revoked certificates
