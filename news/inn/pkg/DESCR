This is the public release of version 2.1 of InterNet News (INN). This work
is sponsored by the Internet Software Consortium.

InterNetNews is a complete Usenet system.  The cornerstone of the package
is innd, an NNTP server that multiplexes all I/O. Newsreading is handled
by a separate server, nnrpd, that is spawned for each client.  Both innd
and nnrpd have some slight variances from the NNTP protocol.

You can set the environment variable INN_SPOOL to whatever you like to 
change the default spool directory when building this pkg.
