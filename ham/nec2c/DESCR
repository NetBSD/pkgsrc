nec2c is a translation of the NEC2 FORTRAN source code to the C
language.  The translation was performed mostly "by hand" and a
lot of modifications to the original program were introduced in
order to modernize the NEC2 and to remove as many built-in limitations
as possible. The attendant SOMNEC program was also translated to
C and incorporated in nec2c as a function so that Sommerfeld ground
solutions are a part of the program.
