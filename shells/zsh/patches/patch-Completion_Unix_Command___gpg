$NetBSD: patch-Completion_Unix_Command___gpg,v 1.2 2022/05/16 14:58:30 ryoon Exp $

Fix an issue in _gpg. Simply typing "gpg2 [TAB]" fails with an error:

  _gpg:176: \[]*} not found

[pho@] I couldn't figure out what was really going on. These nested
parameter expansions don't look wrong, yet zsh-5.8 somehow fails to
process them. Maybe it's misinterpreted as an indexed array
assignment? Creating arrays with unquoted values is a bad idea anyway,
because they can easily cause shell expansions in a totally unexpected
way.
