mksh is the MirBSD enhanced version of the Public Domain Korn shell (pdksh),
a Bourne-compatible shell which is largely similar to the original AT&T
Korn shell; mksh is the only pdksh derivate currently being actively developed.
It includes bug fixes and feature improvements, in order to produce a modern,
robust shell good for interactive and especially script use.

The code has been thoroughly cleaned up and simplified, bugs fixed, standards
compliance added, and several enhancements (for extended compatibility to other
modern shells, as well as a couple of its own) have been placed. mksh has UTF-8
support (e.g. in the emacs editing mode).
