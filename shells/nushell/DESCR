Hello, and welcome to the Nushell project. The goal of this project is to take
the Unix philosophy of shells, where pipes connect simple commands together, and
bring it to the modern style of development.

Nu takes cues from a lot of familiar territory: traditional shells like bash,
advanced shells like PowerShell, functional programming, systems programming,
and more. But rather than trying to be the jack of all trades, Nu focuses its
energy on doing a few things well:
-Create a flexible cross-platform shell with a modern feel
-Allow you to mix and match commandline applications with a shell that
understands the structure of your data
-Have the level of UX polish that modern CLI apps provide

The easiest way to see what Nu can do is to start with some examples, so let's
dive in, https://www.nushell.sh/book/
