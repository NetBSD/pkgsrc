wizards is a package designed for the quick and painless development
of interrogative programs, which revolve around a dialogue with the
user, who is asked a series of questions in a sequence much like an
installation wizard.

Everything from interactive system scripts, to installation wizards,
to full-blown shells can be implemented with the support of wizards.

It is developed transparently on top of a free monad, which separates
out the semantics of the program from any particular interface. A
variety of backends exist, including console-based
"System.Console.Wizard.Haskeline" and "System.Console.Wizard.BasicIO",
and the pure "System.Console.Wizard.Pure". It is also possible to
write your own backends, or extend existing back-ends with new
features. While both built-in IO backends operate on a console, there
is no reason why wizards cannot also be used for making GUI wizard
interfaces.
