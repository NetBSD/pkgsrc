This module provides a syntax plugin that implements exception-handling
semantics in a form familiar to users of other languages, being built on
a block labeled with the try keyword, followed by at least one of a
catch or finally block.

Syntax similar to this module has now been added to core perl, starting
at version 5.34.0. If you are writing new code, it is suggested that you
instead use the Feature::Compat::Try module instead, as that will enable
the core feature on those supported perl versions, falling back to
Syntax::Keyword::Try on older perls.
