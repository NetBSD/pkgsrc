This is the portable version of the Game of Trees (GoT) version control
system.

Primary features of GoT include:

* Prioritizes ease of use and simplicity over flexibility.
* Designed from scratch using a OpenBSD-style C code base and licensed
  under ISC.
* Uses Git repositories to store versioned data. GoT is fully compatible
  with Git, making it possible to work with both Got and Git on the same
  repository.
