hatch-fancy-pypi-readme is a Hatch metadata plugin for everyone who cares about
the first impression of their projectâ€™s PyPI landing page. It allows you to
define your PyPI project description in terms of concatenated fragments that
are based on static strings, files, and most importantly: parts of files
defined using cut-off points or regular expressions.
