To complete the setup you will need to read the Bugzilla-Guide.txt in order
to setup mySQL properly.  In particular secion 2.2.2 of the document deals
with database setup.  After the initial setup of the database you can then
check the settings in ${BZDIR}/localconfig and:

	cd ${BZDIR}
	./checksetup.pl

You will need to make Bugzilla accessible through your HTTP server.
If you are running Apache then you may add the following lines to httpd.conf:

	DirectoryIndex index.cgi index.html
	Include ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/httpd/bugzilla.conf

to make Bugzilla accessible through:

	http://www.domain.com/bugzilla/index.cgi

IMPORTANTLY: CHANGE YOUR DATABASE PASSWORD FROM THE DEFAULT !!
