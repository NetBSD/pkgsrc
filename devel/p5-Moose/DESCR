Moose is an extension of the Perl 5 object system. The main goal of
Moose is to make Perl 5 Object Oriented programming easier, more
consistent and less tedious. With Moose you can think more about what
you want to do and less about the mechanics of OOP.

Additionally, Moose is built on top of Class::MOP, which is a metaclass
system for Perl 5. This means that Moose not only makes building normal
Perl 5 objects better, but it provides the power of metaclass
programming as well.
