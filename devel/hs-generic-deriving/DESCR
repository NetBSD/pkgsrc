This package provides functionality for generalising the deriving mechanism
in Haskell to arbitrary classes. It was first described in the paper:

  A generic deriving mechanism for Haskell. Jose Pedro Magalhaes,
  Atze Dijkstra, Johan Jeuring, and Andres Loeh. Haskell'10.

The current implementation integrates with the new GHC Generics. See
http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/GHC.Generics for more information.
Template Haskell code is provided for supporting GHC before version 7.2.
