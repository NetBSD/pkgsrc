Developer's Image Library (DevIL) is a programmer's library to develop
applications with very powerful image loading capabilities, yet is easy
for a developer to learn and use. Ultimate control of images is left to
the developer, so unnecessary conversions, etc. are not performed. DevIL
utilizes a simple, yet powerful, syntax. DevIL can load, save, convert,
manipulate, filter and display a wide variety of image formats.

Currently, DevIL can load .bmp, .cut, .dds, .doom, .gif, .ico, .jpg, .lbm,
.mdl, .mng, .pal, .pbm, .pcd, .pcx, .pgm, .pic, .png, .ppm, .psd, .psp,
.raw, .sgi, .tga and .tif files.

Formats supported for saving include .bmp, .dds, .h, .jpg, .pal, .pbm,
.pcx, .pgm,.png, .ppm, .raw, .sgi, .tga and .tif.

DevIL currently supports the following APIs for display: OpenGL, Windows GDI,
SDL, DirectX and Allegro. Compilers that can compile DevIL or use it
include Djgpp, MSVC++, Linux gcc, Delphi, Visual Basic, Power Basic and
Dev-C++.
