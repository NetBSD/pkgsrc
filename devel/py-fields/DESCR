Container class boilerplate killer.

Features:

* Human-readable __repr__
* Complete set of comparison methods
* Keyword and positional argument support. Works like a normal
  class - you can override just about anything in the subclass
  (eg: a custom __init__). In contrast, hynek/characteristic
  forces different call schematics and calls your __init__ with
  different arguments.
