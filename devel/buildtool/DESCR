Buildtool is a portable build infrastructure that can be used in the
development of any kind of program. Basically, it simplifies the build
process of a program from user's point of view, by automatically
configuring the source code with specific details of the host system;
it also makes developer's work easier because all Makefile complexity
is hidden and behavior is homogenized. These are probably its main
features, but Buildtool can do much more!

Buildtool is completly free, licensed under the terms of the BSD
license. It can be thought as the BSD replacement of GNU automake,
autoconf and libtool.
