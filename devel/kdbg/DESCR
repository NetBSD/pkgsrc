KDbg is a graphical user interface to gdb, the GNU debugger. It provides an
intuitive interface for setting breakpoints, inspecting variables, and stepping
through code.  

KDbg requires KDE, the K Desktop Environment, but you can of course debug any
program.  

Features:
o 	Inspection of variable values in a tree structure. 
o	Direct member: For certain compound data types the most important
	member values are displayed next to the variable name, so that it is
	not necessary to expand the subtree of that variable in order to see
	the member value. For example, you don't need to go into a variable of
	type QString if you want to see the string that the variable holds.
	KDbg can also display Qt 2.0's QString values, which are Unicode
	strings. 
o	Debugger at your finger tips: The basic debugger functions (step, next,
	run, finish, until, set/clear/enable/disable breakpoint) are bound to
	function keys F5 through F10. Quick and easy. 
o	Of course, lots of other basic functions: View source code, search
	text, set program arguments and environment variables, display
	arbitrary expressions. Everything you need to debug a program, eh! 
o	Debugging of core dumps, attaching to running processes is possible. 
o	Conditional breakpoints.
