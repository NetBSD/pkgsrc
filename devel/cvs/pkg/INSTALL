    Set up the master source repository.  See the "Setting up the repository"
    section of cvs.info for details; the one-line summary is (if you are
    putting the repository in /src/master):
    $ cvs -d /src/master init

    Have all users of the CVS system set the CVSROOT environment
    variable appropriately to reflect the placement of your source
    repository.  If the above example is used, the following commands
    can be placed in user's ~/.profile, ~/.bash_profile file; or in the
    site-wide /etc/profile:

	CVSROOT=/src/master; export CVSROOT

    for sh/bash/ksh users, or place the following commands in the user's
    ~/.cshrc, ~/.login, or /etc/chsrc file:

	setenv CVSROOT /src/master

    for csh/tcsh users.  If these environment variables are not already set
    in your current shell, set them now (or source the login script you
    just edited).
