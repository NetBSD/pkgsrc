bcolz provides columnar and compressed data containers. Column storage
allows for efficiently querying tables with a large number of
columns. It also allows for cheap addition and removal of column. In
addition, bcolz objects are compressed by default for reducing
memory/disk I/O needs. The compression process is carried out
internally by Blosc, a high-performance compressor that is optimized
for binary data.
