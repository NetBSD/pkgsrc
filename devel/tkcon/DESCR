tkcon is a replacement for the standard console that comes with Tk (on
Windows/Mac, but also works on Unix).  tkcon provides many more features
than the standard console and works on all platforms where Tcl/Tk is
available.  It is meant primarily to aid one when working with the little
details inside tcl and tk and to give Unix users the GUI console provided
by default in the Mac and Windows Tk.
