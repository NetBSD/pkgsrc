execnet provides carefully tested means to ad-hoc interact with Python
interpreters across version, platform and network barriers. It provides
a minimal and fast API targetting the following uses:
* distribute tasks to local or remote processes
* write and deploy hybrid multi-process applications
* write scripts to administer multiple hosts

Features
* zero-install bootstrapping: no remote installation required!
* flexible communication: send/receive as well as callback/queue mechanisms
  supported
* simple serialization of python builtin types (no pickling)
* grouped creation and robust termination of processes
* well tested between CPython 2.6-3.X, Jython 2.5.1 and PyPy 2.2 interpreters.
* interoperable between Windows and Unix-ish systems.
* integrates with different threading models, including standard os threads,
  eventlet and gevent based systems.
