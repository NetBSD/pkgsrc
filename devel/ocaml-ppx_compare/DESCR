Generation of fast comparison functions from type expressions and definitions.

Ppx_compare is a ppx rewriter that derives comparison functions from type
representations. The scaffolded functions are usually much faster than ocaml's
Pervasives.compare. Scaffolding functions also gives you more flexibility by
allowing you to override them for a specific type and more safety by making
sure that you only compare comparable values.
