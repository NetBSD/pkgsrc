# RUnit

Runit is a testing package for R code, inspired by the xUnit family of testing
tools.

Originally implemented by Thomas Koenig, Klaus Juenemann, and Matthias Burger,
this package has served the R community for over a decade.

Since RUnit is no longer actively developed, I provide maintenance of this
package mostly to support older projects that still rely on RUnit.

# Using RUnit

To make RUnit work with `R CMD check`, create a following file in the `tests`
subdirectory. This would run the actual tests stored in the packages
`inst/tests` subdirectory.
