plaster is a loader interface around multiple config file formats.
It exists to define a common API for applications to use when they
wish to load configuration. The library itself does not aim to
handle anything except a basic API that applications may use to
find and load configuration settings. Any specific constraints
should be implemented in a pluggable loader which can be registered
via an entrypoint.
