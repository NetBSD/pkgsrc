importlib_resources is a backport of Python standard library importlib.resources
module for older Pythons. The key goal of this module is to replace parts of
pkg_resources with a solution in Python's stdlib that relies on well-defined APIs.
This makes reading resources included in packages easier, with more stable and
consistent semantics.
