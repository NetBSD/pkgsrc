# \todo Understand upstream's dependency rules and add/fix.
# (Upstream's docs are very confusing as they are not listed in a
# generic manner but only for a few specific operating systems, and
# blur what is in their wheels for various platforms vs what
# dependencies are needed.)
# \todo Consider options as audio/video may be too heavy.
