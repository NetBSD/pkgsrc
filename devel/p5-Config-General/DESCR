Config::General opens a config file and parses it's contents for
you. After parsing the module returns a hash structure which contains
the representation of the config file.

The format of config files supported by Config::General is inspired
by the well known apache config format, in fact, this module is
100% read-compatible to apache configs, but you can also just use
simple name/value pairs in your config files.
