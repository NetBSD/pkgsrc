Tasty is a modern testing framework for Haskell.

It lets you combine your unit tests, golden tests,
QuickCheck/SmallCheck properties, and any other types of tests into a
single test suite.

Features:

* Run tests in parallel but report results in a deterministic order
* Filter the tests to be run using patterns specified on the command
  line
* Hierarchical, colored display of test results
* Reporting of test statistics
* Acquire and release resources (sockets, temporary files etc.) that
  can be shared among several tests
* Extensibility: add your own test providers and ingredients (runners)
  above and beyond those provided
