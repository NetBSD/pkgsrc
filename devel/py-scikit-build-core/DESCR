Scikit-build-core is a build backend for Python that uses CMake to
build extension modules. It has a simple yet powerful static
configuration system in pyproject.toml, and supports almost unlimited
flexibility via CMake. It was initially developed to support the
demanding needs of scientific users, but can build any sort of
package that uses CMake.

Scikit-build-core is a ground-up rewrite of the classic Scikit-build.
