The l3experimental packages are a collection of experimental
implementations for aspects of the LaTeX3 kernel, dealing with
higher-level ideas such as the Designer Interface. Some of them
work as stand alone packages, providing new functionality, and
can be used on top of LaTeX2e with no changes to the existing
kernel. The present release includes: l3benchmark for measuring
the time taken by TeX to run certain code; l3draw, a code-level
interface for constructing drawings; l3graphics, an interfaces
for the inclusion of graphics files; l3opacity, support for
opacity in PDF output; l3str, support for string manipulation;
l3sys-shell, which provides abstractions for common shell
functions like file deletion and copying; xcoffins, which
allows the alignment of boxes using a series of 'handle'
positions, supplementing the simple TeX reference point;
xgalley, which controls boxes receiving text for typesetting.
