The goal of the Subversion project is to build a version control system that
is a compelling replacement for CVS in the open source community. The software
is released under an Apache/BSD-style open source license.

This package contains all the Subversion programs and libraries except
the Apache module mod_dav_svn (for which see the ap2-subversion
package) and the Python bindings and some programs which use them (for
which see the py-subversion package).  Installing this package
alone will satisfy most people's needs, providing all three repository
access layers (local, svn, and dav) and the server for the svn access
layer.

This package tracks 1.6.x release branch.
