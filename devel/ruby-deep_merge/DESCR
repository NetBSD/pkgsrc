DeepMerge Overview
==================

Deep Merge is a simple set of utility functions for Hash.  It permits you to
merge elements inside a hash together recursively.  The manner by which it
does this is somewhat arbitrary (since there is no defining standard for
this) but it should end up being pretty intuitive and do what you expect.

You can learn a lot more about this by reading the test file. It's pretty
well documented and has many examples of various merges from very simple to
pretty complex.

The primary need that caused me to write this library is the merging of
elements coming from HTTP parameters and related stored parameters in
session.  This lets a user build up a set of parameters over time, modifying
individual items.
