Provides functions available in later versions of @base@ to a wider
range of compilers, without requiring you to use CPP pragmas in your
code.

This package provides the same API as the
@<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-compat base-compat>@
library, but depends on compatibility packages (such as @semigroups@)
to offer a wider support window than @base-compat@, which has no
dependencies. Most of the modules in this library have the same names
as in @base-compat@ to make it easier to switch between the two. There
also exist versions of each module with the suffix @.Repl.Batteries@,
which are distinct from anything in @base-compat@, to allow for easier
use in GHCi.
