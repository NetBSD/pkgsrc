An extension for RT4 that makes RT parse the content of Articles as
a template, when inserting the article into a ticket, using the
Text::Template module; this can be used to make your Articles dynamic.
Text::Template is the same module that RT's Templates use as well.
You need this extension to be able to generate form responses that
contain fields from the ticket.
