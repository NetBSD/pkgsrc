AutoDia is an open-source, auto-documentation and auto-diagramming 
system allowing you to automatically generate Images, XML, HTML or Dia files.

It has been written to make GNOME Dia and any Diagram Application that 
can use similar XML more powerful. I hope to make Dia more popular than
the commercial equivilents because of the ability to vastly extend it in
this way.

AutoDia's design goals have been good Object Orientation such as
plenty of abstraction, use of inheritance, extensability, robustness
and elegance. Speed and security are not concerns as this application is
designed to generate xml for documents in a batch processing manner, not
an interactive manner, and is a single user application for use from the
console.

AutoDia has been previously known as autodial. The output file is still 
called autodia.out.dia by default. The executable files are now called
autodia.pl and autodia_java.pl, the only difference being an additional
section near the start of the latter to enable INLINE::Java.
