This is a library for the GitHub API which performs no I/O of its
own (a sans-I/O library). This allows users to choose whatever HTTP
library they prefer while parceling out GitHub-specific details to
this library. This base library is then built upon to provide an
abstract base class to a cleaner API to work with. Finally,
implementations of the abstract base class are provided for
asynchronous HTTP libraries for immediate usage.
