This is Bruce Evans' C compiler and binutils package.

It is able to generate 16-bit code. Hence it's possible to compile BIOS
and DOS code under unix.

The C compiler understands K&R1 syntax, with a few restrictions
regarding bitfields.  See the file bcc/bcc-cc1/bcc.bugs in the
distfile for Bruce's bug list.

The binutils (assembler and loader) have been renamed to as86 and ld86
to not conflict with the system's assembler and loader, but they are
also available in the regular BINDIR (normally /usr/local/bin).

It's also possible to generate MC 6809 code with bcc/as.  (This is a
compile-time option however, and not supported by this package.
