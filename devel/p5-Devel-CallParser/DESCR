This module provides a C API, for XS modules, concerned with custom
parsing. It is centred around the function cv_set_call_parser, which
allows XS code to attach a magical annotation to a Perl subroutine,
resulting in resolvable calls to that subroutine having their
arguments parsed by arbitrary C code. (This is a more conveniently
structured facility than the core's PL_keyword_plugin API.) This
module makes cv_set_call_parser and several supporting functions
available.

This module provides the implementation of the functions at
runtime. It also, at compile time, supplies the C header file and link
library which provide access to the functions. In normal use,
"callparser0_h"/"callparser1_h" and "callparser_linkable" should be
called at build time (not authoring time) for the module that wishes
to use the C functions.
