PyChecker is a tool for finding bugs in python source code.
It finds problems that are typically caught by a compiler for less
dynamic languages, like C and C++.  It is similar to lint.
Because of the dynamic nature of python, some warnings
may be incorrect; however, spurious warnings should be fairly infrequent.
