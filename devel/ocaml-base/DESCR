Base is a standard library for OCaml. It provides a standard set of general
purpose modules that are well-tested, performant, and fully-portable across
any environment that can run OCaml code. Unlike other standard library
projects, Base is meant to be used as a wholesale replacement of the standard
library distributed with the OCaml compiler. In particular it makes different
choices and doesn't re-export features that are not fully portable such as
I/O, which are left to other libraries.
