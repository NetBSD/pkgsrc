Modern concurrency tools including agents, futures, promises, thread pools,
actors, supervisors, and more.

Inspired by Erlang, Clojure, Go, JavaScript, actors, and classic concurrency
patterns.

The design goals of this gem are:

* Be an 'unopinionated' toolbox that provides useful utilities without
  debating which is better or why
* Remain free of external gem dependencies
* Stay true to the spirit of the languages providing inspiration
* But implement in a way that makes sense for Ruby
* Keep the semantics as idiomatic Ruby as possible
* Support features that make sense in Ruby
* Exclude features that don't make sense in Ruby
* Be small, lean, and loosely coupled

This is version 1.1.10 package.
