libsigc++ implements a full callback system for use in widget
libraries, abstract interfaces, and general programming. Originally
part of the Gtk-- widget set, libsigc++ is now a seperate library to
provide for more general use. It is the most complete library of its
kind with the ablity to connect an abstract callback to a class
method, function, or function object. It contains adaptor classes for
connection of dissimilar callbacks and has an ease of use unmatched by
other C++ callback libraries. Libsigc++ is licensed under the GNU
Library General Public License, LGPL.
