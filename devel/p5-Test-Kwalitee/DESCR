Kwalitee is an automatically-measurable gauge of how good your
software is. That's very different from quality, which a computer
really can't measure in a general sense. (If you can, you've solved
a hard problem in computer science.)

In the world of the CPAN, the CPANTS project (CPAN Testing Service;
also a funny acronym on its own) measures Kwalitee with several
metrics. If you plan to release a distribution to the CPAN -- or
even within your own organization -- testing its Kwalitee before
creating a release can help you improve your quality as well.

Test::Kwalitee and a short test file will do this for you automatically.
