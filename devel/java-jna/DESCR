JNA provides Java programs easy access to native shared libraries
without writing anything but Java code - no JNI or native code is
required.  This functionality is comparable to Windows' Platform/Invoke
and Python's ctypes.

JNA allows you to call directly into native functions using natural Java
method invocation. The Java call looks just like the call does in native code.
Most calls require no special handling or configuration; no boilerplate or
generated code is required.

JNA uses a small JNI library stub to dynamically invoke native code.
The developer uses a Java interface to describe functions and structures
in the target native library. This makes it quite easy to take advantage of
native platform features without incurring the high overhead of configuring
and building JNI code for multiple platforms. Read this more in-depth
description.

While significant attention has been paid to performance, correctness and
ease of use take priority.

In addition, JNA includes a platform library with many native functions already
mapped as well as a set of utility interfaces that simplify native access.
