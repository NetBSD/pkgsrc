IO::Event

Provides low level cross-platform primitives for constructing event loops,
with support for select, kqueue, epoll and io_uring.

Motivation

The initial proof-of-concept Async was built on NIO4r.  It was perfectly
acceptable and well tested in production, however being built on libev was a
little bit limiting.  I wanted to directly built my fiber scheduler into the
fabric of the event loop, which is what this gem exposes - it is
specifically implemented to support building event loops beneath the fiber
scheduler interface, providing an efficient C implementation of all the core
operations.
