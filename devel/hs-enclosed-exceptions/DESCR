The purpose of this module is to allow you to capture all exceptions
originating from within the enclosed computation, while still reacting to
asynchronous exceptions aimed at the calling thread.

This way, you can be sure that the function that calls, for example,
catchAny, will still respond to ThreadKilled or Timeout events raised by
another thread (with throwTo), while capturing all exceptions, synchronous
or asynchronous, resulting from the execution of the enclosed computation.

One particular use case is to allow the safe execution of code from various
libraries (which you do not control), capturing any faults that might
occur, while remaining responsive to higher level events and control
actions.
