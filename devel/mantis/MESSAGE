To complete the setup you will need to read the INSTALL guide in order
to setup MySQL properly.  In particular secion 3 of the document deals
with database setup.

The following URL can be used to complete the installation and database
setup:

	http://localhost/mantis/admin/install.php

You will need to make Mantis accessible through your Apache HTTP server.
If you are running Apache then you may add the following lines to httpd.conf:

	Include ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/mantis.conf

to make Mantis accessible through:

	http://localhost/mantis/index.php


IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTES:

	* Once Mantis is running correctly remove or restrict access to
	  the admin directory.
