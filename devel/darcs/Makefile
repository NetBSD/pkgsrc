# If darcs is to be linked dynamically, it will depend on nearly 140 shared
# objects and the dynamic linker will spend more than a second to resolve
# symbols on startup. This is unacceptable because darcs tends to be
# launched very frequently by users and IDEs. This wastes storage, but time
# is more expensive than disks.
HASKELL_ENABLE_SHARED_LIBRARY=	no

# It makes no sense to build the profiling library because this package
# isn't meant to be used as a library.
HASKELL_ENABLE_LIBRARY_PROFILING=	no
