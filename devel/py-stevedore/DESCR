Python makes loading code dynamically easy, allowing you to configure
and extend your application by discovering and loading extensions
("plugins") at runtime. Many applications implement their own
library for doing this, using __import__ or importlib. stevedore
avoids creating yet another extension mechanism by building on top
of setuptools entry points. The code for managing entry points
tends to be repetitive, though, so stevedore provides manager
classes for implementing common patterns for using dynamically
loaded extensions.
