explain( @things_to_explain )

Will convert the contents of any references in a human readable
format, and return them as strings. Usually you want to pass this into
note or diag.

Handy for things like:

  is( $errors, [], 'Should have no errors' ) or diag explain( $errors );

Note that explain does NOT output anything.
