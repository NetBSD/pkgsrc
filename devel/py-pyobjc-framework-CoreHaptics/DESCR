The PyObjC project aims to provide a bridge between the Python and Objective-C
programming languages. The bridge is intended to be fully bidirectional,
allowing the Python programmer to take full advantage of the power provided by
various Objective-C based toolkits and the Objective-C programmer transparent
access to Python based functionality.

This package contains wrappers for framework 'QTKit'.
