Wisper

A micro library providing Ruby objects with Publish-Subscribe capabilities.

* Decouple core business logic from external concerns in Hexagonal style
  architectures.
* Use as an alternative to ActiveRecord callbacks and Observers in Rails
  apps.
* Connect objects based on context without permanence.
* React to events synchronously or asynchronously.

Note: Wisper was originally extracted from a Rails codebase but is not
dependant on Rails.
