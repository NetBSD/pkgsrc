Icecc, also called Icecream is based on distcc. Like distcc, Icecream
takes compile jobs from a build and distributes it among remote
machines allowing a parallel build.

But unlike distcc, Icecream uses a central server that dynamically
schedules the compile jobs to the fastest free server. This advantage
pays off mostly for shared computers, if you're the only user on x
machines, you have full control over them.
