mgdiff is a graphical front-end to the UNIX diff command based upon
X11R[456] and the Motif widget set. It allows the user to select two
files for comparison, runs the diff command, parses the output, and
presents the results graphically. This presentation can also be used to
generate a user-specified merge of the two files into a third file.
