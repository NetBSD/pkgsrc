This module automatically exports a single subroutine, make_varname(), which
returns a string composed of random characters that qualifies as the name for
a Perl variable. The characters are limited to upper- and lower-case letters
in the English alphabet, the numerals from 0 through 9 and the underscore
character. The first character may not be a numeral.
