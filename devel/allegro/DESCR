Allegro is a portable library mainly aimed at video game and multimedia
programming, originally started by Shawn Hargreaves for the DJGPP compiler
in a mixture of C and assembler.

According to the Oxford Companion to Music, Allegro is the Italian for
"quick, lively, bright". It is also a recursive acronym which stands for
"Allegro Low LEvel Game ROutines".

This is the legacy 4.x branch, for the current version see devel/allegro5.
