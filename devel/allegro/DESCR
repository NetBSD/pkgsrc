Allegro is a portable library mainly aimed at video game and multimedia 
programming, originally started by Shawn Hargreaves for the DJGPP compiler

According to the Oxford Companion to Music, Allegro is the Italian for 
"quick, lively, bright". It is also a recursive acronym which stands for 
"Allegro Low LEvel Game ROutines".
