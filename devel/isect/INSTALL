===========================================================================
You need to alias the hostname of the machine which will run isectd to
"isectd" on all the client machines, and add the following to
/etc/services:

#
# isect services
#
isectd		5501/tcp	# isectd
isdexec		5502/tcp	# isdexecd

The port number you specify should not conflict with any others that are
reserved.

You can start the isect daemon by editing /etc/rc.local to run
${PKG_PREFIX}/etc/rc.d/isect.sh.
