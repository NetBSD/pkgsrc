This is a complete replacement and rearchitecture of the Android
project's ADB and fastboot, using libusb1 for USB communications.

This code is mainly targeted to users that need to communicate with
Android devices in an automated fashion, such as in automated
testing. It does not have a daemon between the client and the
device, and therefore does not support multiple simultaneous commands
to the same device.
