The googletest package provides Google's C++ test writing framework. 
It is based on the xUnit architecture and works for a variety of
platforms (Linux, Mac OS X, Windows, Cygwin, Windows CE, and
Symbian). It provides various options for running the tests, a 
rich set of assertions, automatic test discovery, and XML test
report generation. It supports type- and value-parameterized tests,   
death tests, fatal and non-fatal failures, and user-defined
assertions.
