The GNU C++ Class Library is a set of C++ classes that ease implementation
of many common concepts left out of even the most recent C++ standards. 
It includes regular expressions, dynamically linked lists, and more.  This
library requires the libstdc++ available in NetBSD 1.4, and will not work
on earlier releases (earlier releases shipped with a libg++ appropriate
for that release).
