The Intel HEX file format is widely used in microprocessors and
microcontrollers area (embedded systems etc) as the de facto standard
for representation of code to be programmed into microelectronic
devices.

This work implements an intelhex Python library to read, write, create
from scratch and manipulate data from Intel HEX file format.

The distribution package also includes several convenience Python
scripts, including "classic" hex2bin and bin2hex converters and more,
those based on the library itself. Check the docs to know more.
