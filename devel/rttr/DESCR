RTTR stands for Run Time Type Reflection. It describes the ability of a
computer program to introspect and modify an object at runtime. It is also
the name of the library itself, which is written in C++ and released as
open source library.

The goal of this project is to provide an easy and intuitive way to use
reflection in C++.
