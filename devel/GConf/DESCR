GConf is a configuration database system, functionally similar to the
Windows registry but lots better. :-) It's being written for the GNOME
desktop but does not require GNOME; configure should notice if GNOME
is not installed and compile the basic GConf library anyway.

  GConf does require glib, ORBit, libxml, and the popt option parsing
library.  XML will be optional in the future if someone writes another
storage backend.

  There's an introductory article at
http://developer.gnome.org/feature/archive/gconf/gconf.html, written
a while ago but mostly still valid. Also, there's a mailing list
gconf-list@gnome.org, see http://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/gconf-list
