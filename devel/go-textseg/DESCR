go-textseg s an implementation of the Unicode Text Segmentation
specification for Go. Specifically, it currently includes only the
"grapheme cluster" segmentation algorithm.

Each major version of Unicode includes a set of tables that define how
each codepoint participates in the segmentation algorithms. Therefore
any caller of this library must select a specific version of Unicode
to support.

To allow for each caller to make that decision separately even though
multiple callers may coexist in the same program, there is a separate
major release of this module for each supported major Unicode
version. Therefore you can select the specific version you want by
module path.
