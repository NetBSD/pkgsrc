VersionGem

Alternatives

This gem has a very niche purpose, which is:

1. providing introspection of a Version module based on a Version::VERSION
   constant string,
2. while not interfering with gemspec parsing where the VERSION string is
   traditionally used.

If this isn't precisely your use case you may be better off looking at
Versionaire, a wonderful, performant, well-maintained, gem from the
Alchemists.
