This backports namespace reserves a namespace beneath which we can happily
place all of the various features that we want to cut-and-paste from later
Python versions. I hope that this will provide two benefits:

1. It should provide greater sanity, and a bit more organization, in the
   Package Index.
2. When you are ready to port a Python application to a new version of Python,
   you can search the code for any import statements that name a backports
   package, and remove the backports for features that have now "arrived" in
   the version of Python to which you are upgrading.
