importlib_metadata is a library which provides an API for accessing an
installed package's metadata, such as its entry points or its top-level name.
This functionality intends to replace most uses of pkg_resources entry point
API and metadata API. Along with importlib.resources in Python 3.7 and newer
(backported as importlib_resources for older versions of Python), this can
eliminate the need to use the older and less efficient pkg_resources package.

This package supplies third-party access to the functionality of
importlib.metadata including improvements added to subsequent Python versions.
