Module Getopt::Long implements an extended getopt function called
GetOptions(). This function implements the POSIX standard for command
line options, with GNU extensions, while still capable of handling the
traditional one-letter options. In general, this means that command line
options can have long names instead of single letters, and are
introduced with a double dash `--`.

Optionally, Getopt::Long can support the traditional bundling of
single-letter command line options.
