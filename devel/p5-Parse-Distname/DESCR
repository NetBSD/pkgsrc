Parse::Distname is yet another distribution name parser. It works almost the
same as CPAN::DistnameInfo, but Parse::Distname takes a different approach. It
tries to extract a version part of a distribution and treat the rest as a
distribution name, contrary to CPAN::DistnameInfo which tries to define a name
part and treat the rest as a version.
