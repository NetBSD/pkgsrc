+.Pp
 Integer constants in bases other that decimal may be specified as
 n%dddd...  where n is a decimal number indicating the base and dddd...
 are digits in that base.  For bases > 10, letters are used for digits
 above 9.  Examples:  8%77, 16%2ff, 2%0010011.  The number is converted
 the equivalent decimal value using multiplication; this may cause sign
 problems if the number has too many digits.
-
+.Pp
 String literals ("..." or '...') can be continued across line boundaries
 by ending the line to be continued with an underline.  The underline is
 not included as part of the literal.  Leading blanks and tabs on the
 next line are ignored; this facilitates consistent indentation.

+.Sh HISTORY
+Derived from a preprocessor distributed by the University of Arizona
+(not derived from AT&T code). Closely corresponds to the preprocessor
+described in the "SOFTWARE TOOLS" book.
+.Pp
+.Sh BUGS
+The switch statment switches on an integer valued expression.  It
+should switch on an integer variable.  The reason is that "implicit
+undefined" "implicit null" is unusable because the switch is done on a
+new variable that is not declared or declarable by the programmer who
+cannot guess its name. (This is not really a bug but a design error in
+both AT&T ratfor and this public domain ratfor).
+.Pp
+.Sh COPYING
+This code is in the public domain. In other words, all rights
+are granted to all recipients, "public" at large.
