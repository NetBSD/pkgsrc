Various small helper functions for Lists, Maybes, Tuples, Functions.
Some of these functions are improved implementations of standard
functions.  They have the same name as their standard counterparts.
Others are equivalent to functions from the base package, but if you
import them from this utility package then you can write code that
runs on older GHC versions or other compilers like Hugs and JHC.

All modules are plain Haskell 98.  The package depends exclusively on
the @base@ package and only that portions of base that are simple to
port.  Thus you do not risk a dependency avalanche by importing it.
However, further splitting the base package might invalidate this
statement.
