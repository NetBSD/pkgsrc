This collection contains implementations for aspects of the
LaTeX3 kernel, dealing with higher-level ideas such as the
Designer Interface. The packages here are considered broadly
stable (The LaTeX3 Project does not expect the interfaces to
alter radically). These packages are built on LaTeX2e
conventions at the interface level, and so may not migrate in
the current form to a stand-alone LaTeX3 format. Packages
provided: xparse, which provides a high-level interface for
declaring document commands xfp, an expandable IEEE 754 FPU for
LaTeX l3keys2e, which makes the facilities of the kernel module
l3keys available for use by LaTeX 2e packages xtemplate, which
provides a means of defining generic functions using a
key-value syntax xfrac, which provides flexible split-level
fractions
