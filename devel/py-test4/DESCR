The pytest framework makes it easy to write small tests, yet scales to support
complex functional testing for applications and libraries.

Features
* Detailed info on failing assert statements (no need to remember self.assert*
  names);
* Auto-discovery of test modules and functions;
* Modular fixtures for managing small or parametrized long-lived test
  resources;
* Can run unittest (including trial) and nose test suites out of the box;
* Rich plugin architecture, with over 315+ external plugins and thriving
  community;

This package contains the last version supporting python 2.7.
