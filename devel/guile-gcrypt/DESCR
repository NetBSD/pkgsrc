Guile-Gcrypt provides a Guile 2.x interface to a subset of the
GNU Libgcrypt crytographic library, which is itself used by the
GNU Privacy Guard (GPG).

Guile-Gcrypt provides modules for cryptographic hash functions,
message authentication codes (MAC), public-key cryptography, strong
randomness, and more. It is implemented using the foreign function
interface (FFI) of Guile.
