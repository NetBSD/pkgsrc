Log::Any allows CPAN modules to safely and efficiently log messages, while
letting the application choose (or decline to choose) a logging mechanism
such as Log::Dispatch or Log::Log4perl.

Log::Any has a very tiny footprint and no dependencies beyond Perl 5.6,
which makes it appropriate for even small CPAN modules to use. It defaults
to 'null' logging activity, so a module can safely log without worrying
about whether the application has chosen (or will ever choose) a logging
mechanism.

The application, in turn, may choose one or more logging mechanisms via
Log::Any::Adapter.
