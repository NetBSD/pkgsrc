Breezy (brz) is a decentralized revision control system, designed to be
easy for developers and end users alike.

By default, Breezy provides support for both the `Bazaar
<https://www.bazaar-vcs.org>`_ and `Git <https://www.git-scm.com/>`_ file
formats.

To learn how to use Breezy, see the official documentation in the `doc`
directory or refer to the Bazaar documentation at
<https://www.breezy-vcs.org/doc/en/>.

Breezy is a friendly fork of the Bazaar (``bzr``) project, hosted on
http://bazaar.canonical.com/. It is backwards compatibility with
Bazaar's disk format and protocols. One of the key differences with
Bazaar is that Breezy also runs on Python 3.3 and later, in addition to
Python 2.7.
