base-orphans defines orphan instances that mimic instances available
in later versions of base to a wider (older) range of
compilers. base-orphans does not export anything except the orphan
instances themselves and complements base-compat. See the README for
what instances are covered:
https://github.com/haskell-compat/base-orphans#readme. See also the
what is not covered section.
