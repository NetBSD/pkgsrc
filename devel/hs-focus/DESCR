An API for construction of free-form strategies of access and manipulation
of elements of arbitrary data structures. It allows to implement efficient
composite patterns, e.g., a simultaneous update and lookup of an element,
and even more complex things.

Strategies are meant to be interpreted by the host data structure
libraries. Thus they allow to implement all access and modification
patterns of a data structure with just a single function, which interprets
strategies.

This library provides pure and monadic interfaces, so it supports both
immutable and mutable data structures.
