Bonobo is a set of language and system independant CORBA interfaces
for creating reusable components, controls and creating compound
documents.

We distinguish between `Bonobo' the name of the component architecture,
and `bonobo' which is the C-based easy to use implemenatation of the
Bonobo component architecture.

libbonobo contains a rich API for dealing Bonobo Objects (activation
for example).
