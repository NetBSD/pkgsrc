Guppy3 is a programming environment providing object and heap memory sizing,
profiling and analysis. It includes a prototypical specification language that
can be used to formally specify aspects of Python programs and generate tests
and documentation from a common source.

Modules which constitute the environment:

- Heapy: debugging and optimization regarding memory related issues in Python
  programs
- GSL (Guppy Specification Language): describes aspects of a system, especially
  its API, in a way that can be automatically converted to tests as well as to
  documents
- Guppy: umbrella package combining Heapy and GSL with support utilities such as
  the Glue module that keeps things together
