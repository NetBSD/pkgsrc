+.SH "NAME"
+\fBjq\fR \- Command\-line JSON processor
+.
+.SH "SYNOPSIS"
+\fBjq\fR [\fIoptions\fR\.\.\.] \fIfilter\fR [\fIfiles\fR\.\.\.]
+.
+.P
+\fBjq\fR can transform JSON in various ways, by selecting, iterating, reducing and otherwise mangling JSON documents\. For instance, running the command \fBjq \'map(\.price) | add\'\fR will take an array of JSON objects as input and return the sum of their "price" fields\.
+.
+.P
+By default, \fBjq\fR reads a stream of JSON objects (whitespace separated) from \fBstdin\fR\. One or more \fIfiles\fR may be specified, in which case \fBjq\fR will read input from those instead\.
+.
+.P
+The \fIoptions\fR are described in the \fIINVOKING JQ\fR section, they mostly concern input and output formatting\. The \fIfilter\fR is written in the jq language and specifies how to transform the input document\.
+.
+.SH "FILTERS"
+A jq program is a "filter": it takes an input, and produces an output\. There are a lot of builtin filters for extracting a particular field of an object, or converting a number to a string, or various other standard tasks\.
+.
+.P
+Filters can be combined in various ways \- you can pipe the output of one filter into another filter, or collect the output of a filter into an array\.
+.
+.P
+Some filters produce multiple results, for instance there\'s one that produces all the elements of its input array\. Piping that filter into a second runs the second filter for each element of the array\. Generally, things that would be done with loops and iteration in other languages are just done by gluing filters together in jq\.
+.
+.P
+It\'s important to remember that every filter has an input and an output\. Even literals like "hello" or 42 are filters \- they take an input but always produce the same literal as output\. Operations that combine two filters, like addition, generally feed the same input to both and combine the results\. So, you can implement an averaging filter as \fBadd / length\fR \- feeding the input array both to the \fBadd\fR filter and the \fBlength\fR filter and dividing the results\.
+.
+.P
+But that\'s getting ahead of ourselves\. :) Let\'s start with something simpler:
+.
+.SH "INVOKING JQ"
+jq filters run on a stream of JSON data\. The input to jq is parsed as a sequence of whitespace\-separated JSON values which are passed through the provided filter one at a time\. The output(s) of the filter are written to standard out, again as a sequence of whitespace\-separated JSON data\.
+.
+.P
+You can affect how jq reads and writes its input and output using some command\-line options:
+.
+.TP
+\fB\-\-slurp\fR/\fB\-s\fR:
+.
+.IP
+Instead of running the filter for each JSON object in the input, read the entire input stream into a large array and run the filter just once\.
+.
+.TP
+\fB\-\-raw\-input\fR/\fB\-R\fR:
+.
+.IP
+Don\'t parse the input as JSON\. Instead, each line of text is passed to the filter as a string\. If combined with \fB\-\-slurp\fR, then the entire input is passed to the filter as a single long string\.
+.
+.TP
+\fB\-\-null\-input\fR/\fB\-n\fR:
+.
+.IP
+Don\'t read any input at all! Instead, the filter is run once using \fBnull\fR as the input\. This is useful when using jq as a simple calculator or to construct JSON data from scratch\.
+.
+.TP
+\fB\-\-compact\-output\fR / \fB\-c\fR:
+.
+.IP
+By default, jq pretty\-prints JSON output\. Using this option will result in more compact output by instead putting each JSON object on a single line\.
+.
+.TP
+\fB\-\-colour\-output\fR / \fB\-C\fR and \fB\-\-monochrome\-output\fR / \fB\-M\fR:
+.
+.IP
+By default, jq outputs colored JSON if writing to a terminal\. You can force it to produce color even if writing to a pipe or a file using \fB\-C\fR, and disable color with \fB\-M\fR\.
+.
+.TP
+\fB\-\-ascii\-output\fR / \fB\-a\fR:
+.
+.IP
+jq usually outputs non\-ASCII Unicode codepoints as UTF\-8, even if the input specified them as escape sequences (like "\eu03bc")\. Using this option, you can force jq to produce pure ASCII output with every non\-ASCII character replaced with the equivalent escape sequence\.
+.
+.TP
+\fB\-\-raw\-output\fR / \fB\-r\fR:
+.
+.IP
+With this option, if the filter\'s result is a string then it will be written directly to standard output rather than being formatted as a JSON string with quotes\. This can be useful for making jq filters talk to non\-JSON\-based systems\.
+.
+.SH "BASIC FILTERS"
+nil
+.
+.SS "\."
+The absolute simplest (and least interesting) filter is \fB\.\fR\. This is a filter that takes its input and produces it unchanged as output\.
+.
+.P
+Since jq by default pretty\-prints all output, this trivial program can be a useful way of formatting JSON output from, say, \fBcurl\fR\.
+.
+.IP "" 4
+.
+.nf
+
+jq \'\.\'
+   "Hello, world!"
+=> "Hello, world!"
+.
+.fi
+.
+.IP "" 0
+.
+.SS "\.foo"
+The simplest \fIuseful\fR filter is \.foo\. When given a JSON object (aka dictionary or hash) as input, it produces the value at the key "foo", or null if there\e\'s none present\.
+.
+.IP "" 4
+.
+.nf
+
+jq \'\.foo\'
+   {"foo": 42, "bar": "less interesting data"}
+=> 42
+
+jq \'\.foo\'
+   {"notfoo": true, "alsonotfoo": false}
+=> null
+.
+.fi
+.
+.IP "" 0
+.
+.SS "\.[foo]"
+You can also look up fields of an object using syntax like \fB\.["foo"]\fR (\.foo above is a shorthand version of this)\. This one works for arrays as well, if the key is an integer\. Arrays are zero\-based (like javascript), so \.[2] returns the third element of the array\.
+.
+.IP "" 4
+.
+.nf
+
+jq \'\.[0]\'
+   [{"name":"JSON", "good":true}, {"name":"XML", "good":false}]
+=> {"name":"JSON", "good":true}
+
+jq \'\.[2]\'
+   [{"name":"JSON", "good":true}, {"name":"XML", "good":false}]
+=> null
+.
+.fi
+.
+.IP "" 0
+.
+.SS "\.[]"
+If you use the \fB\.[foo]\fR syntax, but omit the index entirely, it will return \fIall\fR of the elements of an array\. Running \fB\.[]\fR with the input \fB[1,2,3]\fR will produce the numbers as three seperate results, rather than as a single array\.
+.
+.IP "" 4
+.
+.nf
+
+jq \'\.[]\'
+   [{"name":"JSON", "good":true}, {"name":"XML", "good":false}]
+=> {"name":"JSON", "good":true}, {"name":"XML", "good":false}
+
+jq \'\.[]\'
+   []
+=>
+.
+.fi
+.
+.IP "" 0
+.
+.SS ","
+If two filters are separated by a comma, then the input will be fed into both and there will be multiple outputs: first, all of the outputs produced by the left expression, and then all of the outputs produced by the right\. For instance, filter \fB\.foo, \.bar\fR, produces both the "foo" fields and "bar" fields as separate outputs\.
+.
+.IP "" 4
+.
+.nf
+
+jq \'\.foo, \.bar\'
+   {"foo": 42, "bar": "something else", "baz": true}
+=> 42, "something else"
+
+jq \'\.user, \.projects[]\'
+   {"user":"stedolan", "projects": ["jq", "wikiflow"]}
+=> "stedolan", "jq", "wikiflow"
+
+jq \'\.[4,2]\'
+   ["a","b","c","d","e"]
+=> "e", "c"
+.
+.fi
+.
+.IP "" 0
+.
+.SS "|"
+The | operator combines two filters by feeding the output(s) of the one on the left into the input of the one on the right\. It\e\'s pretty much the same as the Unix shell\e\'s pipe, if you\e\'re used to that\.
+.
+.P
+If the one on the left produces multiple results, the one on the right will be run for each of those results\. So, the expression \fB\.[] | \.foo\fR retrieves the "foo" field of each element of the input array\.
+.
+.IP "" 4
+.
+.nf
+
+jq \'\.[] | \.name\'
+   [{"name":"JSON", "good":true}, {"name":"XML", "good":false}]
+=> "JSON", "XML"
+.
+.fi
+.
+.IP "" 0
+.
+.SH "TYPES AND VALUES"
+jq supports the same set of datatypes as JSON \- numbers, strings, booleans, arrays, objects (which in JSON\-speak are hashes with only string keys), and "null"\.
+.
+.P
+Booleans, null, strings and numbers are written the same way as in javascript\. Just like everything else in jq, these simple values take an input and produce an output \- \fB42\fR is a valid jq expression that takes an input, ignores it, and returns 42 instead\.
+.
+.SS "Array construction \- []"
+As in JSON, \fB[]\fR is used to construct arrays, as in \fB[1,2,3]\fR\. The elements of the arrays can be any jq expression\. All of the results produced by all of the expressions are collected into one big array\. You can use it to construct an array out of a known quantity of values (as in \fB[\.foo, \.bar, \.baz]\fR) or to "collect" all the results of a filter into an array (as in \fB[\.items[]\.name]\fR)
+.
+.P
+Once you understand the "," operator, you can look at jq\e\'s array syntax in a different light: the expression [1,2,3] is not using a built\-in syntax for comma\-separated arrays, but is instead applying the \fB[]\fR operator (collect results) to the expression 1,2,3 (which produces three different results)\.
+.
+.P
+If you have a filter \fBX\fR that produces four results, then the expression \fB[X]\fR will produce a single result, an array of four elements\.
+.
+.IP "" 4
+.
+.nf
+
+jq \'[\.user, \.projects[]]\'
+   {"user":"stedolan", "projects": ["jq", "wikiflow"]}
+=> ["stedolan", "jq", "wikiflow"]
+.
+.fi
+.
+.IP "" 0
+.
+.SS "Objects \- {}"
+Like JSON, \fB{}\fR is for constructing objects (aka dictionaries or hashes), as in: \fB{"a": 42, "b": 17}\fR\.
+.
+.P
+If the keys are "sensible" (all alphabetic characters), then the quotes can be left off\. The value can be any expression (although you may need to wrap it in parentheses if it\e\'s a complicated one), which gets applied to the {} expression\e\'s input (remember, all filters have an input and an output)\.
+.
+.IP "" 4
+.
+.nf
+
+{foo: \.bar}
+.
+.fi
+.
+.IP "" 0
+.
+.P
+will produce the JSON object \fB{"foo": 42}\fR if given the JSON object \fB{"bar":42, "baz":43}\fR\. You can use this to select particular fields of an object: if the input is an object with "user", "title", "id", and "content" fields and you just want "user" and "title", you can write
+.
+.IP "" 4
+.
+.nf
+
+{user: \.user, title: \.title}
+.
+.fi
+.
+.IP "" 0
+.
+.P
+Because that\e\'s so common, there\e\'s a shortcut syntax: \fB{user, title}\fR\.
+.
+.P
+If one of the expressions produces multiple results, multiple dictionaries will be produced\. If the input\e\'s
+.
+.IP "" 4
+.
+.nf
+
+{"user":"stedolan","titles":["JQ Primer", "More JQ"]}
+.
+.fi
+.
+.IP "" 0

+then the expression
+.
+.IP "" 4
+.
+.nf
+
+{user, title: \.titles[]}
+.

+.
+.IP "" 0
+.

+will produce two outputs:

+{"user":"stedolan", "title": "More JQ"}
+.

+.SH "BUILTIN OPERATORS AND FUNCTIONS"
+Some jq operator (for instance, \fB+\fR) do different things depending on the type of their arguments (arrays, numbers, etc\.)\. However, jq never does implicit type conversions\. If you try to add a string to an object you\'ll get an error message and no result\.
+.

+.SH "VARIABLES AND FUNCTIONS"
+Variables are an absolute necessity in most programming languages, but they\'re relegated to an "advanced feature" in jq\.
+.
+.P
+In most languages, variables are the only means of passing around data\. If you calculate a value, and you want to use it more than once, you\'ll need to store it in a variable\. To pass a value to another part of the program, you\'ll need that part of the program to define a variable (as a function parameter, object member, or whatever) in which to place the data\.
+.
+.P
+It is also possible to define functions in jq, although this is is a feature whose biggest use is defining jq\'s standard library (many jq functions such as \fBmap\fR and \fBfind\fR are in fact written in jq)\.
+.
+.SS "Variables"
+In jq, all filters have an input and an output, so manual plumbing is not necessary to pass a value from one part of a program to the next\. Many expressions, for instance \fBa + b\fR, pass their input to two distinct subexpressions (here \fBa\fR and \fBb\fR are both passed the same input), so variables aren\'t usually necessary in order to use a value twice\.
+.
+.P
+For instance, calculating the average value of an array of numbers requires a few variables in most languages \- at least one to hold the array, perhaps one for each element or for a loop counter\. In jq, it\'s simply \fBadd / length\fR \- the \fBsum\fR expression is given the array and produces its sum, and the \fBcount\fR expression is given the array and produces its length\.
+.
+.P
+So, there\'s generally a cleaner way to solve most problems in jq that defining variables\. Still, sometimes they do make things easier, so jq lets you define variables using \fBexpression as $variable\fR\. All variable names start with \fB$\fR\. Here\'s a slightly uglier version of the array\-averaging example:
+.
+.IP "" 4
+.
+.nf
+
+length as $array_length | add / $array_length
+.
+.fi
+.
+.IP "" 0
+.
+.P
+We\'ll need a more complicated problem to find a situation where using variables actually makes our lives easier\.
+.
+.P
+Suppose we have an array of blog posts, with "author" and "title" fields, and another object which is used to map author usernames to real names\. Our input looks like:
+.
+.IP "" 4
+.
+.nf
+
+{"posts": [{"title": "Frist psot", "author": "anon"},
+           {"title": "A well\-written article", "author": "person1"}],
+ "realnames": {"anon": "Anonymous Coward",
+               "person1": "Person McPherson"}}
+.
+.fi
+.
+.IP "" 0
+.
+.P
+We want to produce the posts with the author field containing a real name, as in:
+.
+.IP "" 4
+.
+.nf
+
+{"title": "Frist psot", "author": "Anonymous Coward"}
+{"title": "A well\-written article", "author": "Person McPherson"}
+.
+.fi
+.
+.IP "" 0
+.
+.P
+We use a variable, $names, to store the realnames object, so that we can refer to it later when looking up author usernames:
+.
+.IP "" 4
+.
+.nf
+
+\&\.realnames as $names | \.posts[] | {title, author: $names[\.author]}
+.
+.fi
+.
+.IP "" 0
+.
+.P
+The expression "foo as $x" runs foo, puts the result in $x, and returns the original input\. Apart from the side\-effect of binding the variable, it has the same effect as "\."\.
+.
+.P
+Variables are scoped over the rest of the expression that defines them, so
+.
+.IP "" 4
+.

+
+\&\.realnames as $names | (\.posts[] | {title, author: $names[\.author]})
+.

+.SS "Defining Functions"
+You can give a filter a name using "def" syntax:
+.
+.IP "" 4
+.
+.nf
+
+def increment: \. + 1;
+.
+.fi
+.
+.IP "" 0
+.
+.P
+From then on, \fBincrement\fR is usable as a filter just like a builtin function (in fact, this is how some of the builtins are defined)\. A function may take arguments:
+.
+.IP "" 4
+.
+.nf
+
+def map(f): [\.[] | f];
+.
+.fi
+.
+.IP "" 0
+.
+.P
+Arguments are passed as filters, not as values\. The same argument may be referenced multiple times with different inputs (here \fBf\fR is run for each element of the input array)\. Arguments to a function work more like callbacks than like value arguments\.
+.
+.P
+If you want the value\-argument behaviour for defining simple functions, you can just use a variable:
+.
+.IP "" 4
+.
+.nf
+
+def addvalue(f): f as $value | map(, + $value);
+.
+.fi
+.
+.IP "" 0
+.
+.P
+With that definition, \fBaddvalue(\.foo)\fR will add the current input\'s \fB\.foo\fR field to each element of the array\.

+.

+
+jq \'def addvalue(f): \. + [f]; map(addvalue(\.[0]))\'

+.SH "ASSIGNMENT"
+Assignment works a little differently in jq than in most programming languages\. jq doesn\'t distinguish between references to and copies of something \- two objects or arrays are either equal or not equal, without any further notion of being "the same object" or "not the same object"\.
+.
+.P
+If an object has two fields which are arrays, \fB\.foo\fR and \fB\.bar\fR, and you append something to \fB\.foo\fR, then \fB\.bar\fR will not get bigger\. Even if you\'ve just set \fB\.bar = \.foo\fR\. If you\'re used to programming in languages like Python, Java, Ruby, Javascript, etc\. then you can think of it as though jq does a full deep copy of every object before it does the assignment (for performance, it doesn\'t actually do that, but that\'s the general idea)\.
+.
+.SS "="
+The filter \fB\.foo = 1\fR will take as input an object and produce as output an object with the "foo" field set to 1\. There is no notion of "modifying" or "changing" something in jq \- all jq values are immutable\. For instance,
+.
+.P
+\&\.foo = \.bar | \.foo\.baz = 1
+.
+.P
+will not have the side\-effect of setting \.bar\.baz to be set to 1, as the similar\-looking program in Javascript, Python, Ruby or other languages would\. Unlike these languages (but like Haskell and some other functional languages), there is no notion of two arrays or objects being "the same array" or "the same object"\. They can be equal, or not equal, but if we change one of them in no circumstances will the other change behind our backs\.
+.
+.P
+This means that it\'s impossible to build circular values in jq (such as an array whose first element is itself)\. This is quite intentional, and ensures that anything a jq program can produce can be represented in JSON\.
+.
+.SS "|="
+As well as the assignment operator \'=\', jq provides the "update" operator \'|=\', which takes a filter on the right\-hand side and works out the new value for the property being assigned to by running the old value through this expression\. For instance, \.foo |= \.+1 will build an object with the "foo" field set to the input\'s "foo" plus 1\.
+.
+.P
+This example should show the difference between \'=\' and \'|=\':
+.
+.P
+Provide input \'{"a": {"b": 10}, "b": 20}\' to the programs:
+.
+.P
+\&\.a = \.b \.a |= \.b
+.
+.P
+The former will set the "a" field of the input to the "b" field of the input, and produce the output {"a": 20}\. The latter will set the "a" field of the input to the "a" field\'s "b" field, producing {"a": 10}\.
+.
+.SS "+=, \-=, *=, /=, //="
+jq has a few operators of the form \fBa op= b\fR, which are all equivalent to \fBa |= \. op b\fR\. So, \fB+= 1\fR can be used to increment values\.
+.
+.IP "" 4

+.
+.SS "Complex assignments"
+Lots more things are allowed on the left\-hand side of a jq assignment than in most langauges\. We\'ve already seen simple field accesses on the left hand side, and it\'s no surprise that array accesses work just as well:
+.
+.IP "" 4
+.
+.nf
+
+\&\.posts[0]\.title = "JQ Manual"
+.
+.fi
+.
+.IP "" 0
+.
+.P
+What may come as a surprise is that the expression on the left may produce multiple results, referring to different points in the input document:
+.
+.IP "" 4
+.
+.nf
+
+\&\.posts[]\.comments |= \. + ["this is great"]
+.
+.fi
+.
+.IP "" 0
+.
+.P
+That example appends the string "this is great" to the "comments" array of each post in the input (where the input is an object with a field "posts" which is an array of posts)\.
+.
+.P
+When jq encounters an assignment like \'a = b\', it records the "path" taken to select a part of the input document while executing a\. This path is then used to find which part of the input to change while executing the assignment\. Any filter may be used on the left\-hand side of an equals \- whichever paths it selects from the input will be where the assignment is performed\.
+.
+.P
+This is a very powerful operation\. Suppose we wanted to add a comment to blog posts, using the same "blog" input above\. This time, we only want to comment on the posts written by "stedolan"\. We can find those posts using the "select" function described earlier:
+.
+.IP "" 4
+.
+.nf
+
+\&\.posts[] | select(\.author == "stedolan")
+.
+.fi
+.
+.IP "" 0
+.
+.P
+The paths provided by this operation point to each of the posts that "stedolan" wrote, and we can comment on each of them in the same way that we did before:
+.
+.IP "" 4

+
+(\.posts[] | select(\.author == "stedolan") | \.comments) |=
