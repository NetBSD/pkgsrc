This the G App Libs (GAL).

This module contains some library functions that came from Gnumeric
and Evolution.  The idea is to reuse those widgets across various
larger GNOME applications that might want to use these widgets.

Please notice that these widgets are currently licensed under the
terms of the GNU GPL (with the exception of the gtk-combo-box which is
under the LGPL).  If you want to contribute code to the official
distirbution of this code you have to sign a copyright assignment to
Helix Code.  This would allow Helix Code in the future to redistribute
the code it fully owns under a difference license.

The API is not frozen and might change at any time.  Larger class
renaming might happen at any point without notice.  Use this library
at your own risk.
