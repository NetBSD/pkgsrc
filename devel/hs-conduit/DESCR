conduit is a solution to the streaming data problem, allowing for
production, transformation, and consumption of streams of data in constant
memory. It is an alternative to lazy I/O which guarantees deterministic
resource handling, and fits in the same general solution space as
enumerator/iteratee and pipes. For a tutorial, please visit
