Meld is a visual diff and merge tool. You can compare two or three
files and edit them in place (diffs update dynamically). You can
compare two or three folders and launch file comparisons. You can
browse and view a working copy from popular version control systems
such such as CVS, Subversion, Bazaar-ng and Mercurial.
