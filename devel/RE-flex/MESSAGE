RE/flex has its own built-in regex engine, but other regex engines from the
following packages may be used as well:

    devel/boost-{headers,libs}
    devel/pcre2

It is possible to generate FSM graphs by using 'reflex' with the
'--graphs-file' option and installing this package:

    graphics/graphviz

A vim Flex and RE/flex syntax highlighting mode file is included in
the package and can by used by copying
    ${PREFIX}/share/doc/${PKGBASE}/lex.vim to ~/.vim/syntax
