picotrace is designed to be a framework for other more advanced tracers, and an
example of the canonical usage of ptrace(2). New features are not expected
unless they reflect a new feature in the kernel.

For historical reasons this repository is called picotrace, although it now
contains other software as well:

 * sigtracer
 * singlestepper
 * NetBSD strace
 * NetBSD truss
 * coredumper
