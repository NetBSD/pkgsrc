Console

Provides beautiful console logging for Ruby applications.  Implements fast,
buffered log output.

Motivation

When Ruby decided to reverse the order of exception backtraces, I finally
gave up using the built in logging and decided restore sanity to the output
of my programs once and for all!

Features

* Thread safe global logger with per-fiber context.
* Carry along context with nested loggers.
* Enable/disable log levels per-class.
* Detailed logging of exceptions.
* Beautiful logging to the terminal or structured logging using JSON.
