optimist

Description

Optimist is a commandline option parser for Ruby that just gets out of your
way.  One line of code per option is all you need to write.  For that, you
get a nice automatically-generated help page, robust option parsing, and
sensible defaults for everything you don't specify.

Features

* Dirt-simple usage.
* Single file.  Throw it in lib/ if you don't want to make it a Rubygem
  dependency.
* Sensible defaults.  No tweaking necessary, much tweaking possible.
* Support for long options, short options, subcommands, and automatic type
  validation and conversion.
* Automatic help message generation, wrapped to current screen width.

Requirements

* A burning desire to write less code.
