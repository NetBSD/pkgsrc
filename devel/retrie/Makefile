# If retrie is to be linked dynamically, it will depend on more than 80
# shared objects and the dynamic linker will spend too much time to resolve
# symbols on startup. This is unacceptable because retrie tends to be
# launched very frequently by editors and IDEs. This wastes storage, but
# time is more expensive than disks.
HASKELL_ENABLE_DYNAMIC_EXECUTABLE=	no

# retrie is built with optparse-applicative, and can generate shell
# completion scripts automatically.
