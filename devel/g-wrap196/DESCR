G-Wrap is a tool (and Guile library) for generating function wrappers
for inter-language calls. It currently only supports generating Guile
wrappers for C functions.

This package provides G-Wrap TNG (to be 2.0), with the following
goals:

  * Use GOOPS, for enhanced flexibility

  * Get rid of the cruft that has accumulated, simplify where possible
    without sacrificing features

  * Be target-language agnostic; i.e. clean separation of the core and
    e.g. the Guile-specific code. New languages (perhaps even
    non-Schemes) should be easy to add.

  * Offer the current (1.3.4+) wrapping API as a compatibility layer.

This package contains the 1.9.6 version of g-wrap because it's
the last one that's compatible with gnucash 2.0.x.
