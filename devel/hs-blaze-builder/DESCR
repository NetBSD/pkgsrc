This library provides an implementation of the older blaze-builder
interface in terms of the new builder that shipped with
bytestring-0.10.4.0

This implementation is mostly intended as a bridge to the new builder,
so that code that uses the old interface can interoperate with code
that uses the new implementation. Note that no attempt has been made
to preserve the old internal modules, so code that has these
dependencies cannot use this interface.

New code should, for the most part, use the new interface. However,
this module does implement a chunked HTTP encoding, which is not
otherwise implemented (yet?) with the new builder.
