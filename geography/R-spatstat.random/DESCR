Functionality for random generation of spatial data in the 'spatstat'
family of packages. Generates random spatial patterns of points
according to many simple rules (complete spatial randomness, Poisson,
binomial, random grid, systematic, cell), randomised alteration of
patterns (thinning, random shift, jittering), simulated realisations
of random point processes including simple sequential inhibition,
Matern inhibition models, Neyman-Scott cluster processes (using
direct, Brix-Kendall, or hybrid algorithms), log-Gaussian Cox
processes, product shot noise cluster processes and Gibbs point
processes (using Metropolis-Hastings birth-death-shift algorithm,
alternating Gibbs sampler, or coupling-from-the-past perfect
simulation). Also generates random spatial patterns of line segments,
random tessellations, and random images (random noise, random
mosaics). Excludes random generation on a linear network, which is
covered by the separate package 'spatstat.linnet'.
