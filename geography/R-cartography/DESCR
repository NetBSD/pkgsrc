Create and integrate maps in your R workflow. This package helps to
design cartographic representations such as proportional symbols,
choropleth, typology, flows or discontinuities maps. It also offers
several features that improve the graphic presentation of maps, for
instance, map palettes, layout elements (scale, north arrow,
title...), labels or legends. See Giraud and Lambert (2017)
