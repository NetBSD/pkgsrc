QLandkarte M is a moving map application for mobile devices. As QLandkarte GT
it will display mapsets of different resolutions and point to your current
location. Additionally it will record your location data for further use by
QLandkarte GT. It's user interface is optimized to the few buttons of a
typical PDA.

This is experimental pre-alpha software and not targeted towards end-users
in this stage of developement! This package is provided as a convenience to 
QLandkarte M developers only.

Copy or hard-link the qlm executable to a user-writable directory as qlm
wants to put its data files in the same directory as the executable, 
otherwise it will dump core.
