Defines types of spatial data such as point patterns, mainly in two
dimensions, but also in higher dimensions. Provides class support, and
functions for geometrical operations on spatial data, used in the
'spatstat' family of packages. Excludes spatial data on a linear
network, which are covered by the separate package 'spatstat.linnet'.
