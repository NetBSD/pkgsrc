GDAL is a translator library for raster and vector geospatial data
formats that is released under an MIT style Open Source License by the
Open Source Geospatial Foundation.  As a library, it presents a single
raster abstract data model and single vector abstract data model to
the calling application for all supported formats.  It also comes with
a variety of useful command line utilities for data translation and
processing.

This package intends to build support for all formats subject to using
only open source code and avoiding unreasonably large dependencies.
