Provides bindings to the 'Geospatial' Data Abstraction Library
('GDAL') (>= 1.11.4) and access to projection/transformation
operations from the 'PROJ.4' library. The 'GDAL' and 'PROJ.4'
libraries are external to the package, and, when installing the
package from source, must be correctly installed first. From 'rgdal'
1.4.1, provision is made for 'PROJ6' accommodation, with 'PROJ6'
functionality to follow; from 1.4.1 'rgdal' will build and function
when 'PROJ' >= 6. Both 'GDAL' raster and 'OGR' vector map data can be
imported into R, and 'GDAL' raster data and 'OGR' vector data
exported. Use is made of classes defined in the 'sp' package. Windows
and Mac Intel OS X binaries (including 'GDAL', 'PROJ.4' and 'Expat')
are provided on 'CRAN'.
