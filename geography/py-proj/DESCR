The Proj class can convert from geographic (longitude,latitude) to native
map projection (x,y) coordinates and vice versa, or from one map projection
coordinate system directly to another.

The Geod class can perform forward and inverse geodetic, or Great Circle,
computations. The forward computation involves determining latitude,
longitude and back azimuth of a terminus point given the latitude and
longitude of an initial point, plus azimuth and distance. The inverse
computation involves determining the forward and back azimuths and
distance given the latitudes and longitudes of an initial and terminus point
