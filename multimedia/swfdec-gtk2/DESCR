Swfdec is a library for rendering Flash(R) animations and games.  It was
originally designed as a basis library for creating Flash plugins for
GStreamer, but it is a fully standalone library which only use the libart
library for drawing.  Swfdec is released under the LGPL.

This package provides an SWF based pixbuf-loader for GTK.
