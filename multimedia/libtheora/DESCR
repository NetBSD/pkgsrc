Theora is Xiph.Org's first publicly released video codec, intended for
use within the Ogg's project's Ogg multimedia streaming system.  Theora
is derived directly from On2's VP3 codec; currently the two are nearly
identical, varying only in encapsulating decoder tables in the bitstream
headers, but Theora will make use of this extra freedom in the future to
improve over what is possible with VP3.

For the API documentation, install the libtheora-docs package.
