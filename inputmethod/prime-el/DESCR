PRIME is Japanese PRedictive Input  Method Editor.
PRIME predicts the user's input using knowledge of natural languages and the
user's previous input to reduce the difficulty of typing.  For example, when the
user types "ap", intending "application", PRIME might suggest "apple",
"application", and "appointment."  The user then easily selects "application."

Currently, PRIME only supports Japanese.

This package contains an emacs client of PRIME.
