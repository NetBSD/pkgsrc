Please read the general README file as well.

# Instructions

pkgsrc bootstrap installs several tools whose names happen to match
programs already provided by OpenBSD. The two sets of package tools are
not interchangeable, so you'll need to decide which ones should appear
earlier in your PATH -- probably pkgsrc paths before system ones.

Once that's settled, you might think about moving OpenBSD's native
package tools out of the way so they can't get invoked by mistake,
perhaps like so:

	# cd /usr/sbin && for i in pkg_*; do mv $i $i.orig; done

But you probably don't want to do this, because it would (for instance)
also prevent OpenBSD's pkg_add(1) from being invoked on purpose by
fw_update(1).

# Status

pkgsrc bootstrap has been tested on OpenBSD 7.1 (amd64, i386) with the
system-provided clang. Earlier version/platform/compiler combinations
have previously been reported to work.

Once bootstrapped, as is typical with pkgsrc, many packages build as is.
For any particular package that doesn't, fixes are often in OpenBSD
Ports waiting to be borrowed.
