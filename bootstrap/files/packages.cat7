DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     This manual page describes the variables that users of the NetBSD pack-
     ages system can set to alter the configuration of the package system, and
     individual packages.

CCOOMMMMOONN VVAARRIIAABBLLEESS
     This section documents variables that typically apply to all packages.
     Many of these may be set in mk.conf(5).

           ARCH       The architecture, as returned by ``uname -m''.  See
                      uname(1).

           OPSYS      The operating system name, as returned by ``uname -s''.

           LOCALBASE  Where non-X11 based packages will be installed.  The
                      default is _/_u_s_r_/_p_k_g.

           CROSSBASE  Where ``cross'' category packages will be installed.
                      The default is _$_{_L_O_C_A_L_B_A_S_E_}_/_c_r_o_s_s.

           X11BASE    Where X11 is installed on the system, and where ``X11''
                      category packages will be installed.  The default is
                      _/_u_s_r_/_X_1_1_R_6.

           DISTDIR    Where to get gzip'd, tar-balled copies of original
                      sources.  The default is _$_{_P_K_G_S_R_C_D_I_R_}_/_d_i_s_t_f_i_l_e_s.

           MASTER_SITE_BACKUP
                      Backup location(s) for distribution files and patch
                      files if not found locally and ${MAS-
                      TER_SITES}/${PATCH_SITES}.  The defaults are
                      _f_t_p_:_/_/_f_t_p_._N_e_t_B_S_D_._o_r_g_/_p_u_b_/_N_e_t_B_S_D_/_p_a_c_k_a_g_e_s_/_d_i_s_t_f_i_l_e_s_/_$_{_D_I_S_T___S_U_B_D_I_R_}_/
                      and
                      _f_t_p_:_/_/_f_t_p_._f_r_e_e_b_s_d_._o_r_g_/_p_u_b_/_F_r_e_e_B_S_D_/_d_i_s_t_f_i_l_e_s_/_$_{_D_I_S_T___S_U_B_D_I_R_}_/.

           MASTER_SITE_OVERRIDE
                      If set, override the MASTER_SITES setting with this
                      value.

           PACKAGES   A top level directory where all packages go (rather than
                      going locally to each package).  The default is
                      _$_{_P_K_G_S_R_C_D_I_R_}_/_p_a_c_k_a_g_e_s.

           GMAKE      Set to path of GNU make if not in $PATH (default:
                      gmake).

           PKG_FC     Set to the path of the desired Fortran compiler
                      (default: f2c-f77).

           XMKMF      Set to path of ``xmkmf'' if not in $PATH (default: xmkmf
                      -a).

           WRKOBJDIR  A top level directory where, if defined, the separate
                      working directories will get created, and symbolically
                      linked to from _$_{_W_R_K_D_I_R_} (see below).  This is useful
                      for building packages on several architectures, then
                      _$_{_P_K_G_S_R_C_D_I_R_} can be NFS-mounted while _$_{_W_R_K_O_B_J_D_I_R_} is
                      local to every arch.  (It should be noted that
                      _$_{_P_K_G_S_R_C_D_I_R_} should not be set by the user - it is an
                      internal definition which refers to the root of the
                      pkgsrc tree.  It is possible to have many pkgsrc tree
                      instances.)

           PKG_DEVELOPER
                      Run some sanity checks that package developers want:

                      ++oo   make sure patches apply with zero fuzz

                      ++oo   run check-shlibs to see that all binaries will find
                          their shared libs.

           USE_GLX    Says that if Mesa is requested, a package should prefer-
                      ably use a GLX (hardware-accelerated) version of the
                      Mesa library.

           BINPKG_SITES
                      List of sites carrying binary pkgs.

           LOCALPATCHES
                      Directory for local patches that aren't part of pkgsrc.
                      See _p_k_g_s_r_c_/_d_o_c_/_p_k_g_s_r_c_._t_x_t for more information.  ``rel''
                      and ``arch'' are replaced with OS release ( ``1.5'',
                      etc.) and architecture ( ``mipsel'', etc.).

           PKGMAKECONF
                      Location of the _m_k_._c_o_n_f file used by a package's BSD-
                      style Makefile.  If this is not set, MAKECONF is set to
                      _/_d_e_v_/_n_u_l_l to avoid picking up settings used by builds in
                      _/_u_s_r_/_s_r_c.

PPAACCKKAAGGEE SSPPEECCIIFFIICC VVAARRIIAABBLLEESS
     This section documents variables that typically apply to an individual
     package.  Non-Boolean variables without defaults are *mandatory*.

           ONLY_FOR_PLATFORM
                     If set, it lists the values of OS triples (OS-version-
                     platform) that the package will build under.  It can be a
                     glob-style wildcard.

           NOT_FOR_PLATFORM
                     If set, it lists the values of OS triples (OS-version-
                     platform) that the package will not build under.  It can
                     be a glob-style wildcard.

           MAINTAINER
                     The e-mail address of the contact person for this pack-
                     age.  The person who feels responsible for this package,
                     and who is most likely to look at problems or questions
                     regarding this package which have been reported with
                     send-pr(1).  The right person to contact before making
                     major changes to the package.  The default is tech-
                     pkg@NetBSD.org.

           CATEGORIES
                     A list of descriptive categories into which this package
                     falls.

           COMMENT   A one-line description of the package (should not include
                     the package name).

           MASTER_SITES
                     Primary location(s) for distribution files if not found
                     locally.

           PATCH_SITES
                     Primary location(s) for distribution patch files (see
                     PATCHFILES below) if not found locally.

           PKG_DEBUG_LEVEL
                     The level of debugging output which is displayed whilst
                     making and installing the package.  The default value for
                     this is 0, which will not display the commands as they
                     are executed (normal, default, quiet operation); the
                     value 1 will display all shell commands before their
                     invocation, and the value 2 will display both the shell
                     commands before their invocation, and their actual execu-
                     tion progress with sseett --xx will be displayed.

           WRKDIR    A temporary working directory that gets *clobbered* on
                     clean.  The default is _$_{_._C_U_R_D_I_R_}_/_w_o_r_k or
                     _$_{_._C_U_R_D_I_R_}_/_w_o_r_k_._$_{_M_A_C_H_I_N_E___A_R_C_H_} if OBJMACHINE is set.

           WRKSRC    A subdirectory of ${WRKDIR} where the distribution actu-
                     ally unpacks to.  The default is _$_{_W_R_K_D_I_R_}_/_$_{_D_I_S_T_N_A_M_E_}.
                     The value of WRKSRC should be set explicitly if the pack-
                     age does not follow standard conventions and include the
                     package's name as a subdirectory.  Please note that the
                     old NO_WRKSUBDIR definition has been deprecated and
                     should not be used.

           DISTNAME  Name of package or distribution.

           DISTFILES
                     Name(s) of archive file(s) containing distribution.  The
                     default is _$_{_D_I_S_T_N_A_M_E_}_$_{_E_X_T_R_A_C_T___S_U_F_X_}.

           PATCHFILES
                     Name(s) of additional files that contain distribution
                     patches.  There is no default.  Make will look for them
                     at PATCH_SITES (see above).  They will automatically be
                     uncompressed before patching if the names end with
                     ``.gz'' or ``.Z''.

           DIST_SUBDIR
                     Suffix to _$_{_D_I_S_T_D_I_R_}.  If set, all _$_{_D_I_S_T_F_I_L_E_S_} and
                     _$_{_P_A_T_C_H_F_I_L_E_S_} will be put in this subdirectory of
                     _$_{_D_I_S_T_D_I_R_}_.

           ALLFILES  All of _$_{_D_I_S_T_F_I_L_E_S_} and _$_{_P_A_T_C_H_F_I_L_E_S_}.

           IGNOREFILES
                     If some of the _$_{_A_L_L_F_I_L_E_S_} are not checksum-able, set
                     this variable to their names.

           PKGNAME   Name of the package file to create if the _$_{_D_I_S_T_N_A_M_E_}
                     isn't really relevant for the package.  The default is
                     _$_{_D_I_S_T_N_A_M_E_}.

           SVR4_PKGNAME
                     Name of the package file to create if the _$_{_P_K_G_N_A_M_E_}
                     isn't unique enough on a SVR4 system.  The default is
                     _$_{_P_K_G_N_A_M_E_} which may be shortened when you use gensolpkg.
                     Only add SVR4_PKGNAME if _$_{_P_K_G_N_A_M_E_} does not produce an
                     unique package name on a SVR4 system.  The length of
                     SVR4_PKGNAME is limited to 5 characters.

           PKGREVISION
                     This number indicates the package's revision within the
                     NetBSD Packages Collection (pkgsrc).  If set, this will
                     be attached to the PKGNAME variable separated by a
                     ``nb''.

           EXTRACT_ONLY
                     If defined, a subset of _$_{_D_I_S_T_F_I_L_E_S_} you want to actually
                     extract.

           PATCHDIR  A directory containing any additional patches you made to
                     package this software.  The default is
                     _$_{_._C_U_R_D_I_R_}_/_p_a_t_c_h_e_s.

           SCRIPTDIR
                     A directory containing any auxiliary scripts.  The
                     default is _$_{_._C_U_R_D_I_R_}_/_s_c_r_i_p_t_s.

           FILESDIR  A directory containing any miscellaneous additional
                     files.  The default is _$_{_._C_U_R_D_I_R_}_/_f_i_l_e_s.

           PKGDIR    A direction containing any package creation files.  The
                     default is _$_{_._C_U_R_D_I_R_}_/_p_k_g.

           PKG_DBDIR
                     Where package installation is recorded.  The default is
                     _/_v_a_r_/_d_b_/_p_k_g.

           FORCE_PKG_REGISTER
                     If set, it will overwrite any existing package registra-
                     tion information in _$_{_P_K_G___D_B_D_I_R_}_/_$_{_P_K_G_N_A_M_E_}.

           NO_MTREE  If set, will not invoke mtree from _b_s_d_._p_k_g_._m_k from the
                     ``install'' target.

           MTREE_FILE
                     The name of the mtree file.  The default is
                     _/_e_t_c_/_m_t_r_e_e_/_B_S_D_._x_1_1_._d_i_s_t if USE_IMAKE or USE_X11BASE is
                     set, or _/_e_t_c_/_m_t_r_e_e_/_B_S_D_._p_k_g_._d_i_s_t otherwise.

           USE_X11   Instructs the package system that the package will use
                     headers and libraries from X11BASE and so a check must be
                     made that these are available.  If they are not, an
                     IGNORE message will be displayed, and the package will
                     not be built.

           PLIST_SRC
                     Which file(s) to use to build _$_{_P_L_I_S_T_}.  Default is
                     _$_{_P_K_G_D_I_R_}_/_P_L_I_S_T.

           PLIST_SUBST
                     Patterns that get automatically expanded during the PLIST
                     creation.  Takes arguments of the form VARNAME =
                     ``value'' and subsequently replaces every occurrence of
                     ${VARNAME} with value.

           INSTALL_FILE
                     The name of a script which will be invoked when
                     installing binary packages.  If there is a file called
                     _$_{_P_K_G_D_I_R_}_/_I_N_S_T_A_L_L, that file will be used.

           DEINSTALL_FILE
                     The name of a script which will be invoked when de-
                     installing binary packages.  If there is a file called
                     _$_{_P_K_G_D_I_R_}_/_D_E_I_N_S_T_A_L_L, that file will be used.

           MESSAGE   The name of a file which will be displayed during the
                     installation of a package.  No substitution according to
                     MESSAGE_SUBST takes place.  Overrides MESSAGE_SRC.
                     Should not be used.

           MESSAGE_SRC
                     The name of a file which will be displayed when
                     installing a package.  If neither MESSAGE_SRC nor MESSAGE
                     are set, and there is a file called _$_{_P_K_G_D_I_R_}_/_M_E_S_S_A_G_E,
                     that file will be used.  Before displaying the file, sub-
                     stitution according to MESSAGE_SUBST takes place.

           MESSAGE_SUBST
                     This variable takes equations of the form VARNAME =
                     ``value'', and replaces all occurrences of ${VARNAME} in
                     MESSAGE_SRC with value.  By default, substitution is per-
                     formed for LOCALBASE, PKGNAME, PREFIX, X11BASE, and
                     X11PREFIX.

           NO_BIN_ON_CDROM
                     Binaries of this package may not be placed on CDROM.  Set
                     this string to _$_{_R_E_S_T_R_I_C_T_E_D_}.

           NO_BIN_ON_FTP
                     Binaries of this package may not be made available via
                     ftp.  Set this string to _$_{_R_E_S_T_R_I_C_T_E_D_}.

           NO_BUILD  Use a dummy (do-nothing) build target.

           NO_CONFIGURE
                     Use a dummy (do-nothing) configure target.

                     Use a dummy (do-nothing) package target.

           NO_PKG_REGISTER
                     Don't register a package install as a package.

           NO_SRC_ON_CDROM
                     Distfile(s) of this package may not be placed on CDROM.
                     Set this string to _$_{_R_E_S_T_R_I_C_T_E_D_}.

           NO_SRC_ON_FTP
                     Distfile(s) of this package may not be made available via
                     ftp.  Set this string to _$_{_R_E_S_T_R_I_C_T_E_D_}.  If this variable
                     is set, the distfile will not be mirrored by
                     ftp.NetBSD.org.

           NO_DEPENDS
                     Don't verify build of dependencies.

           CHECK_SHLIBS
                     Do not run 'check-shlibs' even if PKG_DEVELOPER is set.
                     This prevents errors on emul/compat packages (e.g., Linux
                     binaries, ...).

           MAKEFILE  Name of the Makefile in ${WRKSRC}, used in the default
                     build and install targets.  Default: ``Makefile''.

           BROKEN    Package is broken.  Set this string to the reason why.

           RESTRICTED
                     Package is restricted.  Set this string to the reason
                     why.

           LICENCE   The package has a non-standard licence, such as share-
                     ware, or non-commercial-use only.  This string should be
                     set to the type of licence the package has, like "share-
                     ware", or "non-commercial-use".  If LICENCE is set, the
                     ACCEPTABLE_LICENCES variable will be searched, if set,
                     for a string matching the licence.

           PASSIVE_FETCH
                     Uses passive ftp(1) to retrieve distribution files.

           REPLACE_PERL
                     Takes a list of files and replaces each occurrence of
                     "/usr/bin/perl", "/usr/local/bin/perl" and
                     "/usr/pkg/bin/perl" in the named files with the value of
                     ${PERL5}.  This can be used to point perl scripts to the
                     proper interpreter that pkgsrc installs.  Note: it looks
                     for the listed files in ${WRKSRC}.

           UNLIMIT_RESOURCES
                     List of process limits which need to be raised to hard
                     limits for building this package.  So far "datasize" and
                     "stacksize" are supported.

           USE_LIBTOOL
                     Says that the package uses _l_i_b_t_o_o_l to manage building of
                     libraries and shared objects, where applicable.

           LTCONFIG_OVERRIDE
                     If set, override the specified _l_t_c_o_n_f_i_g for using the
                     _l_i_b_t_o_o_l package instead of the pkg's own _l_i_b_t_o_o_l.

           USE_FORTRAN
                     Says that the package uses a Fortran compiler for build-
                     ing.

           USE_GMAKE
                     Says that the package uses _g_m_a_k_e.

           USE_JAVA  Says that the package uses a Java virtual machine.

           USE_PERL5
                     Says that the package uses _p_e_r_l_5 for building and run-
                     ning.

           PERL5_REQD
                     Sets the minimum _p_e_r_l_5 version required.  The default is

                     Says that the package uses _i_m_a_k_e.

           USE_MESA  Says that the package uses the Mesa library.  This will
                     include all Mesa components that are not included in the
                     installed X11 distribution.

           USE_SSL   Says that the package uses a SSL library.  The location
                     of the SSL installation can be found in ${SSLBASE}.

           USE_X11BASE
                     Says that the package installs itself into the X11 base
                     directory ${X11BASE}.  This is necessary for packages
                     that install X11 fonts, application default files or
                     Imake rule or template files.

           USE_XAW   Says that the package uses the Athena widget set.

           USE_XPM   Says that the package uses the Xpm library.  If it is not
                     included in the installed X11 distribution the xpm pack-
                     age will be used.

           USE_GTEXINFO
                     Says that the package uses gtexinfo.

           NO_INSTALL_MANPAGES
                     For imake packages that don't like the install.man tar-
                     get.

           HAS_CONFIGURE
                     Says that the package has its own configure script.

           GNU_CONFIGURE
                     Set if you are using GNU configure (optional).

           CONFIGURE_SCRIPT
                     Name of configure script, defaults to _c_o_n_f_i_g_u_r_e.

           CONFIGURE_ARGS
                     Pass these args to configure if ${HAS_CONFIGURE} is set.

           CONFIGURE_ENV
                     Pass these env (shell-like) to configure if
                     _$_{_H_A_S___C_O_N_F_I_G_U_R_E_} is set.

           SCRIPTS_ENV
                     Additional environment variables passed to scripts in
                     _$_{_S_C_R_I_P_T_D_I_R_} executed by _b_s_d_._p_k_g_._m_k.

           MAKE_ENV  Additional environment variables passed to sub-make in
                     build stage.

           CFLAGS    Any CFLAGS you wish passed to the configure script and/or
                     sub-make in build stage.

           LDFLAGS   Any LDFLAGS you wish passed to the configure script
                     and/or sub-make in build stage.  LDFLAGS is pre-loaded
                     with rpath settings for ELF machines depending on the
                     setting of USE_IMAKE or USE_X11BASE.  If you do not wish
                     to override these settings, use LDFLAGS+=.

           MAKE_ENV  Additional environment variables passed to sub-make in
                     build stage.

           INTERACTIVE_STAGE
                     Set this if your package needs to interact with the user
                     during its fetch, configure, build or install stages.
                     Multiple stages may be specified.  The user can then
                     decide to skip this package by setting ${BATCH}.

           FETCH_DEPENDS
                     A list of ``path:dir'' pairs of other packages this pack-
                     age depends upon in the ``fetch'' stage.  ``path'' is the
                     name of a file if it starts with a slash (/), an exe-
                     cutable otherwise.  make will test for the existence (if
                     it is a full pathname) or search for it in your $PATH (if
                     it is an executable) and go into ``dir'' to do a ``make
                     all install'' if it's not found.

           BUILD_DEPENDS
                     A list of ``path:dir'' pairs of other packages this pack-
                     age depends upon to build (between the ``extract'' and
                     ``build'' stages, inclusive).  The test done to determine
                     the existence of the dependency is the same as
                     FETCH_DEPENDS.

           RUN_DEPENDS
                     This definition is deprecated, and is no longer used in
                     the packages collection.  It should be replaced by a sim-
                     ple ``DEPENDS'' definition.

           LIB_DEPENDS
                     This definition is deprecated, and is no longer used in
                     the packages collection.  It should be replaced by a sim-
                     ple ``DEPENDS'' definition.

           DEPENDS   A list of pre-requisite packages.  The format of this
                     entry is ``pkgname:dir''.  If the ``pkgname'' package is
                     not installed, then it will be built and installed from
                     the source package in ``dir''.

           CONFLICTS
                     A list of other ports this package conflicts with.  Use
                     this for packages that install identical set of files.
                     The format of this entry is ``pkgname''.

           RECOMMENDED
                     A list of recommended versions of pre-requisite packages.
                     This should be used together with ``DEPENDS'' to denote
                     which version of a pre-requisite is required and which
                     version is recommended.  The format of this entry is
                     ``pkgname:dir'', the same as for ``DEPENDS''.

           IGNORE_RECOMMENDED
                     If this is set to ``NO'' (the default), then RECOMMENDED
                     pre-requisites will be turned into dependencies.  If set
                     to ``YES'', recommendations will be ignored and a warning
                     will be printed that packages created with this option
                     are not suitable for distribution.

           EXTRACT_CMD
                     Command for extracting archive.  The default is tar(1).

           EXTRACT_SUFX
                     Suffix for archive names.  The default is ``.tar.gz''.

           FETCH_CMD
                     Full path to ftp/http command if not in $PATH.  The
                     default is _/_u_s_r_/_b_i_n_/_f_t_p.

           NO_IGNORE
                     Set this to ``YES'' (most probably in a ``make fetch'' in
                     _$_{_P_K_G_S_R_C_D_I_R_}) if you want to fetch all distfiles, even
                     for packages not built due to limitation by absent X or
                     Motif.

           __PLATFORM_OK
                     Internal variable set if the package is ok to build on
                     this architecture.  Set to ``YES'' to insist on e.g.
                     fetching all distfiles (for interactive use in
                     _$_{_P_K_G_S_R_C_D_I_R_}, mostly.

           BUILD_TARGET
                     The target to pass to make in the package when building.
                     The default is ``all''.

           INSTALL_TARGET
                     The target to pass to make in the package when
                     installing.  The default is ``install''.

           MASTER_SORT
                     List of suffixes for preferred download locations to sort
                     the MASTER_SITES accordingly.

           MASTER_SORT_REGEX
                     Similar to MASTER_SORT, but takes a list of regular
                     expressions for finer grained control.

           OSVERSION_SPECIFIC
                     Used to denote packages, such as LKM's, which are tightly
                     bound to a specific version of the OS.  Such binary pack-
                     ages are not backwards compatible with other versions of
                     the OS, and should be uploaded to a version specific
                     directory on the FTP.  This variable is not currently
                     used by any of the package system internals, but may be
                     used in the future.  Set this to ``YES'' to denote such a
                     package.

MMOOTTIIFF SSUUPPPPOORRTT
     This section documents variables related to the use and installation of
     Motif and/or LessTif.  Also, packages that require a Motif installation
     need to include motif.buildlink.mk.

           USE_MOTIF12
                     Set this in your package if it requires Motif-1.2 headers
                     and/or libraries.  If Motif is not present on your sys-
                     tem, the lesstif12 package will be installed for you.

           MOTIFBASE
                     If set, it points to an existing Motif-2.0 installation.
                     Otherwise, this is set automatically to the directory of
                     the Motif-2.0 installation used.

           MOTIF12BASE
                     If set, it points to an existing Motif-1.2 installation.
                     Otherwise, this is set automatically to the directory of
                     the Motif-1.2 installation used.

           MOTIFLIB  Set automatically to the flags and libraries needed to
                     link the Motif or LessTif library.

     instead of the defaults to retrieve packages from (usually if there's a
     closer or cheaper site).

     `%SUBDIR%' and `${DIST_SUBDIR}' are replaced by a package specific
     strings.

     Variables to change if you want a special behavior:

           ECHO_MSG  Used to print all the ``===>'' style prompts - override
                     this to turn them off.  The default is _/_b_i_n_/_e_c_h_o.

           CLEAR_DIRLIST
                     If set, cause the ``clean-update'' target to completely
                     clean up and lose the list of dependent packages.  Use
                     with care!

           DEPENDS_TARGET
                     The target to execute when a package is calling a depen-
                     dency.  The default depends on the target that is used:
                     ``package'' for ``make package'', ``update'' for ``make
                     update'', and ``reinstall'' for all other targets.

           NOCLEAN   If set, prevent the ``update'' target from cleaning up
                     after itself.

           PKG_VERBOSE
                     If set, print out more information about the automatic
                     manual page handling, and package deletion (see the
                     ``install'', ``deinstall'' and ``update'' targets), and
                     also sets PATCH_DEBUG as well.

           REINSTALL
                     During update, deinstall each package before calling
                     `${DEPENDS_TARGET}' (see the ``update'' target for more
                     information).

           UPDATE_TARGET
                     The target to execute for building a package during
                     ``make update''.  Defaults to ``install''.  Other good
                     targets are ``package'' or ``bin-install''.  Do not set
                     this to ``update'' or you will get stuck in an endless
                     loop!

     This section documents variables used to configure the way manual pages
     are installed by this package.

           MANCOMPRESSED
                     Indicates that the package installs man pages in a com-
                     pressed form.  The default package installs man pages
                     uncompressed.

           INFO_FILES
                     set to the base names of the info files you wish to be
                     installed in the info dir file.  Automatically sets
                     USE_GTEXINFO.

     This section documents the default targets and their behaviors.  If any
     target relies on another target for completion (e.g., the ``install''
     target relies on the ``build'' target), then these targets will be exe-
     cuted beforehand.

           fetch     Retrieves ${DISTFILES} and ${PATCHFILES} into _$_{_D_I_S_T_D_I_R_}
                     as necessary.

           fetch-list
                     Show list of files that would be retrieved by fetch.

           extract   Unpacks ${DISTFILES} into _$_{_W_R_K_D_I_R_}_.

           patch     Apply any provided patches to the source.

           configure
                     Runs either GNU configure, one or more local configure
                     scripts or nothing, depending on what's available.

           build     Actually compile the sources.

           install   Install the results of a build.

           bin-install
                     Install a binary package from local disk and via FTP from
                     a list of sites (see ``BINPKG_SITES'' variable), and do a
                     ``make package'' if no binary package is available any-
                     where.  The arguments given to pkg_add(1) can be set via
                     ``BIN_INSTALL_FLAGS'', e.g., to do verbose operation,
                     etc.

           reinstall
                     Install the results of a build, ignoring ``already
                     installed'' flag.

           deinstall
                     Remove the installation.

           update    Update the installation of the current package and all
                     dependent packages that are installed on the system.

           replace   Update the installation of the current package.  This
                     differs from update in that it does not replace dependent
                     packages.  You will need to install
                     _p_k_g_s_r_c_/_p_k_g_t_o_o_l_s_/_p_k_g___t_a_r_u_p for this target to work.

           package   Create a binary package other people can use.

           clean     Clean the source tree for a package.

           clean-depends
                     Clean the source tree for a package and the packages it
                     depends upon.

           clean-update
                     Clean the source tree for a package and all dependent
                     packages that are installed on the system.

           describe  Try to generate a one-line description for each package
                     for use in INDEX files and the like.

           checksum  Use _f_i_l_e_s_/_m_d_5 to ensure that your distfiles are valid.

           makesum   Generate _f_i_l_e_s_/_m_d_5 (only do this for your own packages!).

           readme    Create a README.html file describing the category or
                     package.  See _$_{_P_K_G_S_R_C_D_I_R_}_/_d_o_c_/_p_k_g_s_r_c_._t_x_t for more
                     details.

           mirror-distfiles
                     Mirror the distfile(s) if they are freely re-dis-
                     tributable.  If NO_SRC_ON_FTP is set in the package's
                     Makefile (usually to _$_{_R_E_S_T_R_I_C_T_E_D_}) then that reason is
                     printed, and the distfile is not mirrored.

     Default sequence for ``all'' is:  fetch checksum extract patch configure
     build.

     NEVER override the ``regular'' targets unless you want to open a major
     can of worms.
