SIP is a collection of tools that makes it very easy to create Python bindings
for C and C++ libraries.  It was originally developed in 1998 to create PyQt,
the Python bindings for the Qt toolkit, but can be used to create bindings for
any C or C++ library.  For example it is also used to generate wxPython, the
Python bindings for wxWidgets.

This package contains major version 6 of sip.
