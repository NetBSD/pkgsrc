Drawterm  is a program that users of non-Plan 9 systems can use to
establish graphical cpu(1) connections with Plan 9 CPU servers.  Just as
a real Plan 9 terminal does, drawterm serves its local name space as
well as some devices (the keyboard, mouse, and screen) to a remote CPU
server, which mounts this name space on /mnt/term and starts a shell.
Typically, either explicitly or via the profile, one uses the shell to
start rio(1).

This is a fork of Russ Cox's drawterm to incorporate features from
Plan9front (http://9front.org), most importantly DP9IK authentication
support (see authsrv(6)) and the TLS based rcpu(1) protocol.
