SIP is a tool that makes it very easy to create Python bindings for
C++ libraries. It was originally developed to create PyQt, the Python
bindings for the Qt toolkit, but can be used to create bindings for any
C++ library.

This package is the final release of SIP v4, which is no longer
supported upstream.  See also x11/py-sip5, for SIP v5, which has an
incompatible API.
