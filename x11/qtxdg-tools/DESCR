User tools for libqtxdg. qtxdg-tools contains a CLI MIME tool, qtxdg-mat,
for handling file associations and opening files with their default
applications.

It is maintained by the LXQt project and needed by LXQt Session, in
order to be used by xdg-utils. Yet it can be used independently from
LXQt, too.
