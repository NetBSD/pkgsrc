xclipboard is used to collect and display text selections that are
sent to the CLIPBOARD by other clients.  It is typically used to
save CLIPBOARD selections for later use.  It stores each CLIPBOARD
selection as a separate string, each of which can be selected.

This is from the modular X.org X11 project.
