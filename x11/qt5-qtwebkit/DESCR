WebKit is an open source web browser engine. WebKit's HTML and JavaScript
code began as a branch of the KHTML and KJS libraries from KDE. As part of
KDE framework KHTML was based on Qt but during their porting efforts Apple's
engineers made WebKit toolkit independent. QtWebKit is a project aiming at
porting this fabulous engine back to Qt.

WARNING: This release is based on an old WebKit revision with known unpatched
vulnerabilities. Please use it carefully and avoid visiting untrusted websites
