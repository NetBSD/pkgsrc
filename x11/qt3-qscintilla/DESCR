QScintilla is a port of Scintilla to the Qt GUI toolkit.
Qt v3 or later is required.
Scintilla is a free source code editing component.  It comes with complete
source code and a license that permits use in any free project or commercial
product.
As well as features found in standard text editing components, Scintilla
includes features especially useful when editing and debugging source code.
These include support for syntax styling, error indicators, code completion and
call tips.  The selection margin can contain markers like those used in
debuggers to indicate breakpoints and the current line.  Styling choices are
more open than with many editors, allowing the use of proportional fonts, bold
and italics, multiple foreground and background colours and multiple fonts.
