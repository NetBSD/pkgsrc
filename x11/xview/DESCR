What Is XView
-------------
XView (X Window-System-based Visual/Integrated Environment for
Workstations) is a user-interface toolkit to support interactive,
graphics-based applications running under the X Window System.  XView
provides a set of pre-built, user-interface objects such as canvases,
scrollbars, menus, and control panels.  The appearance and functionality
of these objects follow the OPEN LOOK Graphical User Interface (GUI)
specification.  XView features an object-oriented style Application
Programmer's Interface (API) that is straightforward and easy to learn. 

This package does not contain anything by itself -- it is a "meta-package"
that depends on other XView packages.  Its sole purpose is to require
dependencies so users can install this package only and have all the XView
stuff pulled in by the port/package dependency mechanism.
