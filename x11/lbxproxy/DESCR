This package provides lbxproxy, the proxy for the Low Bandwidth
extension to X (LBX). Clients connect to lbxproxy, which multiplexes
them over a single connection to the X server, performing various
optimisation to reduce bandwidth usage and/or latency. 

This is from the modular X.org X11 project.
