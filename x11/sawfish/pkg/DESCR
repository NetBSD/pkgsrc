This is sawfish, a highly configurable window manager for X11. It is
known to compile on at least Solaris/sparc and Linux/ix86; it is

Sawfish is an extensible window manager using an Emacs Lisp-like
scripting language--all window decorations are configurable, the basic
idea is to have as much user-interface policy as possible controlled
through the Lisp language. This is no layer on top of twm, but a wholly
new architecture.

Despite this extensibility its policy is currently very minimal
compared to most window managers. Its aim is simply to manage windows
in the most flexible and attractive manner possible. As such it does
not implement desktop backgrounds, applications docks, or other things
that may be achieved through separate applications.

All high-level wm functions are implemented in Lisp for future
extensibility or redefinition. Currently this includes menus (using
GTK+), interactive window moving and resizing, virtual workspaces,
iconification, focus/transient window policies, frame theme definitions
and much more.
