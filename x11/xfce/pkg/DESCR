XFce is an easy-to-use and easy-to-configure environment,
closely resembling CDE in appearance.  XFCE uses the popular
GTK+ toolkit for X11, and features drag'n drop support,
pulldown menus and color icons, 3D widgets, etc. It
also includes its own Window Manager (xfwm), a backdrop 
manager (xfbd), a file manager (xftree), a clock/calendar
(xfclock) and a system sound manager (xfsound) and
a user friendly interface for mouse configuration (xfmouse).
