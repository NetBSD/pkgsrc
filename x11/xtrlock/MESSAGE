By default, xtrlock(1) is installed suid root, this is required to inspect
the user database when locking the screen.

On Linux and OpenBSD, where the shadow file is generally made group-redable
by a '[_]shadow' group, xtrlock will be installed sgid shadow instead.

Privileges are dropped at startup and reacquired only upon unlocking.
