    This version of xclock is a Motif-based variant of the MIT xclock 
program,  with an alarm feature, and a new "cat" mode, in addition to
the analog and digital modes.
The cat image was based on the famous "Kit-Cat" (R)
plastic wall clock, and was designed by Deanna Hohn of DEC Advanced Technology
Development.  The Motif interface, eyes, tails, and the general state
of the program now are a product of Philip Schneider of DEC.
