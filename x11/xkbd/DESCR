Xkbd is a small highly configurable 'virtual' on-screen keyboard for
X11.  It is designed primarily for use on a PDA, but will hopefully be
of use on other devices where a physical keyboard is not present. 

Xkbd uses no widget set and is based purely on xlib. It also
optionally uses the xft library for anti aliased fonts.
