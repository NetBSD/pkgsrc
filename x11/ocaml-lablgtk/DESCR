LablGTK is an Objective Caml interface to GTK+.  This version
supports GTK+ from 2.0 to 2.10.

It uses the rich type system of Objective Caml 3 to provide a
strongly typed, yet very comfortable, object-oriented interface to
GTK+.  This is not that easy if you know the dynamic typing approach
taken by GTK+.
