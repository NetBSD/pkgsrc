This package contains tools from the Qt4 Graphical User Interface
toolkit. This includes Qt Designer; Qt Linguist, lupdate and lrelease
for translating international applications; qm2ts for converting
old .qm ii18n message files; Qt Assistant for finding help; qtconfig
configuration tool (with online help); uic, the User Interface
Compiler; and qmake for creating Makefiles from simple platform-independent
project files.

Qt Designer accelerates GUI application development and maintenance by
offering a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) drag and drop interface
for UI creation and maintenance. Qt Designer employs a vendor neutral,
XML-format for persistent storage, which simplifies the tasks involved
with the creation and layout of dialogs.
