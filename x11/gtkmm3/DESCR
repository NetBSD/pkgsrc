gtkmm is the official C++ interface for the popular GUI library GTK+. Highlights
include typesafe callbacks, and a comprehensive set of widgets that are easily
extensible via inheritance. You can create user interfaces either in code or
with the Glade User Interface designer, using Gtk::Builder. There's extensive
documentation, including API reference and a tutorial.

This is major version 3 of the library using interfaces for GTK3.
