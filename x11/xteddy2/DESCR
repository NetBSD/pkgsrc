Normally, xteddy just sits  around  doing  nothing.  After
all, that's what teddy bears are for. Look at him, talk to
him, place heavy windows on top of  him,  zap  him  around
until  he  becomes dizzy, do what you like; he will always
be your true (albeit virtual) friend.

Unlike  the  original  version  by  Stefan Gustavson, this
version can display other image formats, and comes with a
number of other images - see xteddy_test.
