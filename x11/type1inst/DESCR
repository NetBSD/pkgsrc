type1inst is a small perl script which generates the
"fonts.scale" file required by an X11 server to use any
Type 1 PostScript fonts which exist in a particular
directory.  It gathers this informatiom from the font files
themselves, a task which previously was done by hand.  The
script is also capable of generating the similar "Fontmap"
file used by ghostscript.  It can also generate sample sheets
for the fonts.
