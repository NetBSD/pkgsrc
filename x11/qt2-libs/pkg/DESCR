Qt(TM) is a GUI software toolkit. Qt simplifies the task of writing and
maintaining GUI (graphical user interface) applications. 
Qt is written in C++ and is fully object-oriented. It has everything you need
to create professional GUI applications. And it enables you to create them
quickly. 
Qt is a multi-platform toolkit. When developing software with Qt, you can run
it on the X Window System (Unix/X11) or Microsoft Windows NT and Windows 95/98.
Simply recompile your source code on the platform you want. 
Qt cuts down the complexity in implementing large and complex systems. Its
ingenious signal-slot technology enables true component programming.
