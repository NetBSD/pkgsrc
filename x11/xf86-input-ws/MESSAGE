To use this driver, your xorg.conf file should have an entry like this:

Section "Device"
	Identifier  	"Mouse0"
	Driver      	"ws"
	Option		"Device"	"/dev/wsmouse"
EndSection

This should work with many wscons pointing devices, especially the zaurus.
Please see the ws(4) manual page for more information.
