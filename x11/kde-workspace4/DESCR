The kdebase-workspace package consists of what is the desktop for KDE4.  The
applications and libraries included aren't required to be portable and probably
will only work with X11.  On other desktops such as OS X and Windows, users
wouldn't run these applications, but use the native ones instead.  The typical
application shouldn't have dependencies in workspace unless they are a component
such as a screen-saver or panel applet.
