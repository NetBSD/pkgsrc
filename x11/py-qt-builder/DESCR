PyQt-builder is the PEP 517 compliant build system for PyQt and
projects that extend PyQt.  It extends the SIP build system and uses
Qt's qmake, in conjunction with make, to perform the actual
compilation and installation of extension modules.

PyQt-builder is actually an extension of the PEP 384-compliant SIP bindings
generator and build system. In the simplest cases all that is needed is a
pyproject.toml file that specifies how the bindings are to be generated. More
complicated cases require additional code, typically implemented in a
project.py file.

PyQt-builder doesn't provide any additional command line build tools but does
extend the SIP tools by providing additional command line options and options
that can be specified in the pyproject.toml file. These are implemented by the
pyqtbuild module which also provides an API that can be used by a project's
project.py file.
