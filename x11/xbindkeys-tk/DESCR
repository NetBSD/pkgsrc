xbindkeys is a program that allows you to launch shell commands with
your keyboard or your mouse under X Windows. It links commands to keys
or mouse buttons using a configuration file. It's independent of the
window manager and can capture all keyboard keys (ex: Power, Wake...).

This package provides the xbindkeys_show utility that comes with the
xbindkeys distribution, which needs Tk.
