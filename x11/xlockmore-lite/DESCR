xlock locks the X server until the user enters their password at the
keyboard.  While xlock is running, all new server connections are
refused. The screen saver is disabled.  The mouse cursor is turned
off. The screen is blanked and a changing pattern is put on the
screen.  If a key or a mouse button is pressed then the user is
prompted for the password of the user who started xlock.

If the correct password is typed, then the screen is unlocked and the
X server is restored.  When typing the password, Control-U and
Control-H are active as kill and erase respectively.  To return to the
locked screen, click in the small icon version of the changing
pattern.

This is the "lite" version of xlockmore, without support for GL,
TrueType and XPM pixmaps.
