xidle uses the XScreenSaver(3) extension to receive inactivity events
when a timeout is specified, running a specific program after the
elapsed time.

xidle also monitors the very corner of the given position for pointer
activity and runs a program if the pointer sits there for more than the
specified number of seconds.
