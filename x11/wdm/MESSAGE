To use wdm, you will need to perform the following steps:

1. In case you don't have PKG_RCD_SCRIPTS set in your /etc/mk.conf, copy
   ${PREFIX}/${RCD_SCRIPTS_EXAMPLEDIR}/wdm to /etc/rc.d/wdm and add the following
   line into your /etc/rc.conf

	wdm=YES

2. Stop all other display managers (e.g. xdm, gdm, ...) and disable them
   in /etc/rc.conf.

3. Start wdm by issuing the command

	/etc/rc.d/wdm start
