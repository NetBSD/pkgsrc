A terminal emulator widget for Qt 5.
QTermWidget is an open-source project originally based on the
KDE4 Konsole application, but it took its own direction later on.
The main goal of this project is to provide a Unicode-enabled,
embeddable Qt widget for using as a built-in console
(or terminal emulation widget).
It is compatible with BSD, Linux and OS X.
