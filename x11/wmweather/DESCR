  wmWeather displays your current local weather conditions. You need
to give it a 4-character "METAR" station identifier code (most major
airports have one). Shows station ID, time of last update (i.e. time
the data was updated not the time the App last checked for data),
temperature, dew point, pressure, humidity, and wind speed. The
various entries can be forced to display in a variety of different
units.
