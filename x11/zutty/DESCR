Zutty is a terminal emulator for the X Window System, functionally
similar to several other X terminal emulators such as xterm, rxvt
and countless others. It is also similar to other, much more modern,
GPU-accelerated terminal emulators such as Alacritty and Kitty.
What really sets Zutty apart is its radically simple, yet extremely
efficient rendering implementation, coupled with a sufficiently
complete feature set to make it useful for a wide range of users.
Zutty offers high throughput with low latency, and strives to
conform to relevant (published or de-facto) standards.

Zutty is written in straightforward C++ and only relies on OpenGL
ES 3.1 for rendering, making it trivially portable to windowing
systems other than X and operating systems other than Linux. Zutty
provides a clean implementation written from scratch, resulting in
a minimal, maintainable, modern codebase unencumbered by historical
baggage.
