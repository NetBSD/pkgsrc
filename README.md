pkgsrc
======

[pkgsrc](https://pkgsrc.org) is a framework for building software for a
variety of UNIX-like systems.

It produces binary packages, which can be managed with tools such as
[pkgin](http://pkgin.net/). pkgsrc is highly configurable, supporting
building packages for an arbitrary installation prefix (the default is
`/usr/pkg`), allowing multiple branches to coexist on one machine, a
build options framework, and a compiler transformation framework, among
other advanced features. Unprivileged use and installation is also supported.

pkgsrc is the default package manager for [NetBSD](https://www.NetBSD.org/)
and [SmartOS](https://www.tritondatacenter.com/smartos).
It's also supported as a first-class option in [OmniOS CE](https://omniosce.org/)
and [Oasis Linux](https://github.com/oasislinux/oasis).


Bootstrapping
-------------

To use pkgsrc on operating systems other than NetBSD, you first need to
bootstrap:

	cd pkgsrc/bootstrap
	./bootstrap

Note that this is only for the most simple case, using pkgsrc's defaults.

Please consult `bootstrap/README` and `bootstrap/README.OS` for detailed
information about bootstrapping.

Building packages
-----------------

	cd pkgsrc/category/package-name
	$PREFIX/bin/bmake install

Where `$PREFIX` is where you've chosen to install packages
(typically `/usr/pkg`)

On NetBSD, `bmake` is simply the built-in `make` tool.

To build packages in bulk, tools such as `pkgtools/pbulk` and
`pkgtools/pkg_comp` can be used.
