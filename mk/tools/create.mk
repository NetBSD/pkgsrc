# This Makefile fragment creates tools under ${TOOLS_DIR} that are
# found before similarly-named tools in the system path.
#
#    TOOLS_CREATE is a whitespace-separated list of tools for which a
#       corresponding tool is created.  Either a wrapper script or a
#       symlink is created depending on the tool that is being
#	overridden.
#
# The following variables specify the details of each <tool>:
#
#    TOOLS_CMD.<tool> is the path to the tool under ${TOOLS_DIR}.  This
#	variable is optional, and if left unspecified it defaults to
#	${TOOLS_DIRS}/bin/<tool>.
#
#    TOOLS_ALIASES.<tool> is a whitespace-separated list of names for
#	which <tool> should also be created under ${TOOLS_DIR}.
#
#    TOOLS_PATH.<tool> is the path to the actual command that is
#	invoked when ${TOOLS_CMD.<tool>} is called.  If <tool> should
#	be a symlink, then this variable is required and should be a
#	full path.  If <tool> should be a wrapper, then this variable
#	is required unless TOOLS_SCRIPT.<tool> is defined (see below).
#
# The following variables specify further details of each <tool> and
# if set, cause a wrapper script to be created.
#
#    TOOLS_ARGS.<tool> additional arguments that are passed to the real
#	command ahead of any command-line arguments.  This variable is
#	optional.
#
#    TOOLS_SCRIPT.<tool> specifies the Bourne-shell scriptlet to embed
#	in the wrapper script that is executed when <tool> is called.
# 	This variable is optional, and if left unspecified, then this
# 	is built up from TOOLS_PATH.<tool> and TOOLS_ARGS.<tool> by
# 	default.
#
# The following variables provide shortcuts for creating certain classes
# of tools:
#
#    TOOLS_NOOP is a list of tools that do nothing and return true.
#
#    TOOLS_BROKEN is a list of tools that do nothing and return false.
#
#    TOOLS_GNU_MISSING is a list of tools for which the GNU missing
#	script is invoked in place of the real tool.  This is used
#	primarily to hide GNU auto* tools.
#
#    TOOLS_FAIL is a list of tools that return false and record their
#	call in the .warning directory, which is later shown.
#
# User-settable variables:
#
# TOOLS_ALWAYS_WRAP
#	If defined, all tools are wrapped using a small shell program,
#	even if a symlink were sufficient.  This will record all
#	invocations of the tools in the work log (.work.log by default).
#	It makes the tool invocations slower and is therefore only
#	useful during a debugging session.
