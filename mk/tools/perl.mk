# Packages that need perl as a tool should:
#
#	USE_TOOLS+=	perl	# (or perl:run)
#
# Otherwise they get a warning whenever the perl tool is used, usually in
# the configure phase.  To suppress this warning in case perl is not
# actually needed:
#
#	TOOLS_BROKEN+=	perl
#
# Keywords: perl USE_TOOLS

# ${PERL5}.  These variables depend on PERL5 being properly defined
# and existing on the filesystem.
