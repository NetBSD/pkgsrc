# NAME
#	checksum -- checksum files
#
# SYNOPSIS
#	checksum [options] distinfo [file ...]
#
# DESCRIPTION
#	checksum will verify the checksums in the distinfo file for each
#	of the files specified.
#
#	The checksum utility exits with one of the following values:
#
#	0	All of the file checksums verify.
#
#	1	At least one of the file checksums did not match.
#
#	2	At least one of the files is missing any checksum.
#
#	>2	An error occurred.
#
# OPTIONS
#	-a algorithm	Only verify checksums for the specified algorithm.
#
#	-p		The specified files are patches, so strip out any
#			lines containing NetBSD RCS ID tags before
#			computing the checksums for verification.
#
#	-s suffix	Strip the specified suffix from the file names
#			when searching for the checksum.
