# NAME
#	fetch -- fetch files via URLs
#
# SYNOPSIS
#	fetch [-c] [-d dir] [-f distinfo] [-p hook] [-r] [-v] file [site ...]
#
# DESCRIPTION
#	fetch will attempt to fetch the file from the list of specified
#	sites in the order given.  The complete URL to the file on each
#	site should be the concatenation of the specified site and file.
#	If the file cannot be fetched successfully, then we try the next
#	listed site.
#
#	If the file already exists on the disk and is verified, then
#	no fetch action is taken.
#
# OPTIONS
#	-c	Verify the checksum for the file.  If the checksum
#		does not match, then the fetch is determined to be
#		not successful.
#
#	-d dir	Fetch the files into the specified directory.
#
#	-f distinfo
#		The path to the distinfo file containing the checksums
#		for the file.  The file format should match what is
#		needed by the pkgsrc/mk/checksum/checksum script.
#
#	-p hook
#		After a successful fetch, run hook.  The first argument is
#		the relative path of the distfile and the second argument
#		the full URL the file was obtained from.
#
#	-r	Resume a previous fetch for the file.  In this case,
#		the file is first saved to a ".pkgsrc.resume" file,
#		and is later renamed to the final file name if the
#		complete file has been sucessfully fetched.
#
#	-v	Show the actual command line used to fetch the file
#		from each site.
#
# ENVIRONMENT
#	PKGSRCDIR	This is a hint to help locate the default
#			checksum script.
#
#	CHECKSUM	This is the path to the checksum script used
#			when "-c" is specified.
#
#	FETCH_CMD	This is the actual command used for transferring
#			files from the various sites.
#
#	The following are lists of options to pass to ${FETCH_CMD}:
#
#	FETCH_BEFORE_ARGS
#			These options appear before all other options.
#
#	FETCH_AFTER_ARGS
#			These options appear after all other options.
#
#	FETCH_RESUME_ARGS
#			These options appear just after FETCH_BEFORE_ARGS
#			options and cause ${FETCH_CMD} to resume a
#			previous file transfer.
#
#	FETCH_OUTPUT_ARGS
#			These options specify the name of the local file
#			that will hold the contents of the fetched file.
