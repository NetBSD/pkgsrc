# This Makefile fragment is meant to be included by packages that use any
# BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra System) implementation instead of one particular
# one.
#
# Since pkgsrc always ships BLAS and LAPACK together (as upstream
# implementations do), this adds both BLAS_LIBS and LAPACK_LIBS to the linker
# flags.  Often, they will be identical or at least redundant. LAPACK_LIBS
# does include BLAS_LIBS, in any case.
#
# The C interfaces CBLAS and LAPACKE are also selected
# via BLAS_C_INTERFACE in the package and respective CBLAS_LIBS and
# LAPACKE_LIBS are set. Also, BLAS_INCLUDES is set to preprocessor
# flags to locate/use respective headers.
#
# Note that use of the Accelerate framework is experimental and only
# attempted if user and package explicitly want it.
#
# Keywords: blas lapack netlib atlas openblas mkl
#
# === User-settable variables ===
#
# PKGSRC_BLAS_TYPES
#  This value specifies an exhaustive list of BLAS implementations we wish to
#  use in this pkgsrc installation, in descending order of preference.
#  The implementation selected for a build will be the first one in
#  PKGSRC_BLAS_TYPES that also appears in BLAS_ACCEPTED (see below).
#  Typically set in mk.conf.
#
#  Possible: one or more of netlib, openblas, openblas_pthread,
#    openblas_openmp, accelerate.framework
#    (Accelerate has differing API and needs special handling, might
#    be supported in a few specific packages ony.)
#
#  Default: All currently supported implementations (${_BLAS_TYPES})
#    except accelerate.framework
#
# === Package-settable variables ===
#
# BLAS_ACCEPTED
#   This is a list of blas packages that are compatible with the current
#   package. If not set, any BLAS implementation is OK.
#   Typically set in package Makefile.
#
# BLAS_C_INTERFACE
#   Set to yes if the package requires CBLAS or LAPACKE. This defines
#   BLAS_INCLUDES and pulls in additional packages for netlib. Optimized
#   implementations include the C interfaces in the main library anyway,
#   but you still have the effect on BLAS_INCLUDES.
#
# BLAS_INDEX64
#   Set to yes if the package wants to utilize 64 bit indices.
#
# === Variables automatically set here for use in package builds ===
# 
# BLAS_TYPE
#   This is the BLAS implementation chosen for a particular package build from
#   PKGSRC_BLAS_TYPES and BLAS_ACCEPTED.  If PKGSRC_BLAS_TYPES and
#   BLAS_ACCEPTED have no implementations in common, it defaults to none
#   and the build fails.
# BLAS_LIBS
#   Linker flags used for linking to BLAS library
# LAPACK_LIBS
#   Linker flags used for linking to LAPACK library
#   (including BLAS)
# CBLAS_LIBS
#   Linker flags used for linking to CBLAS library
#   (including BLAS)
# LAPACKE_LIBS
#   Linker flags used for linking to LAPACKE library
#   (including BLAS and LAPACK)
# BLAS_INCLUDES
#   Preprocessor flags to locate/use C interfaces
#   (both for CBLAS and LAPACKE)
# BLAS_PC, CBLAS_PC, LAPACK_PC, LAPACKE_PC
#   Names of pkg-config modules for the respective API. For optimized BLAS,
#   they will usually be identical.
