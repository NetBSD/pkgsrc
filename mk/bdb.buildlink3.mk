#
# This Makefile fragment is meant to be included by packages that
# require a Berkeley DB (BDB) implementation and that are not restricted
# to a single one. The available BDB implementations are db1
# (if builtin) and db[23456].
#
# This Makefile cannot handle packages that can use only a subset of
# { db2 db3 db4 db5 db6 }.
#
# User-settable variables:
#
# BDB_DEFAULT
#	This value represents the package we use when either a db-1.85
#	interface isn't required, or a db-1.85 interface is required,
#	but it's not built-in.
#
#	FIXME: Improve the wording of the text above so that one can
#	understand it.
#
#	Possible: db1 db2 db3 db4 db5 db6
#	Default: db4
#
# BDB185_DEFAULT
#	The package we use when a db-1.85 interface is required.
#	It defaults to "db1" if it's built-in, or to ${BDB_DEFAULT}
#	otherwise.
#
# Package-settable variables:
#
# BDB_ACCEPTED
#	The list of Berkeley DB implementations that can be used by the
#	package.
#
#	FIXME: If the list does not include db1 and does not include
#	BDB_DEFAULT, the package will not build at the moment.
#
# System-defined variables:
#
# BDB_TYPE
#	The name of the selected BDB implementation.
#
# BDBBASE
#	The base directory of the selected BDB implementation. It has
#	subdirectories include/ and lib/.
#
# BDB_LIBS
#	Linker flags to link against the BDB library.

# Note for when databases/db1 is imported:
#   (1) Remove the section that conditionally sets the default
#	value for BDB185_DEFAULT and always set it to be "db1".
#   (2) Remove the special case for ${BDB_TYPE} == "db1" at the end.
#   (3) Move mk/db1.builtin.mk to databases/db1/builtin.mk.
