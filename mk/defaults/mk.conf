# This file provides default values for variables that may be overridden
# in the MAKECONF file, which is /etc/mk.conf by default.
#
# Note: This file is included after the MAKECONF file, so you cannot query
# these default values in the MAKECONF using the ".if" and ".for"
# preprocessing directives.

# ************************************************************************
# NOTE TO PEOPLE EDITING THIS FILE - USE LEADING SPACES, NOT LEADING TABS.
# ************************************************************************

#ALLOW_VULNERABLE_PACKAGES=
# allow the user to build packages which are known to be vulnerable to
# security exploits
# Possible: defined, not defined
# Default: not defined

#AUDIT_PACKAGES_FLAGS=
# List of flags passed to ``pkg_admin audit-pkg''.
#
# Possible: See pkg_admin(1)
# Default: (no option)

MANINSTALL?= maninstall catinstall
# Specify manpage installation types.
# Possible: maninstall, catinstall, both types or empty
# Default: maninstall catinstall
# FIXME: This variable is not user-settable and must be moved away from here.

#MANZ=
# gzip manual pages at installation time
# Possible: defined, not defined
# Default: not defined

GZIP?=	-9
# default compression level when compressing files with gzip
# Possible: -[0-9], --fast, --best (see gzip(1))
# Default: -9

#MAKE_JOBS=	3
#	When defined, specifies the maximum number of jobs ("make -j")
#	that are run in parallel when building packages with the default
#	do-build action. MAKE_JOBS only affects the "build" target,
#	neither "test" nor "install".
#
#	Possible values: any positive integer. Useful values are around
#	the number of processors on the machine.
#
#	Default value: (undefined)
#
#	Warning: This is experimental. Some packages will not build with
#	this. Disabling this for an individual package can be done by
#	setting MAKE_JOBS_SAFE=NO within the per package Makefile.

#MKCRYPTO= no
# If not YES or yes, don't fetch, build or install crypto packages.
# Possible: not defined, no
# Default: yes

#OBJHOSTNAME=
# use hostname-specific object directories, e.g.  work.amnesiac, work.localhost
# OBJHOSTNAME takes precedence over OBJMACHINE (see below).
# Possible: defined, not defined
# Default: not defined

#OBJMACHINE=

PATCH_DEBUG?=
.endif
# Used to debug patches as they are applied
# Possible: defined, not defined
# Default: not defined

PKG_COMPRESSION?=	gzip
# Compression algorithm for binary packages.
# Possible: gzip, bzip2, none
# Default: gzip
# Supersedes the PKG_SUFX option and keeps the name consistent.

PKGSRC_LOCKTYPE?= none
#	The type of locking that will be done if competing processes
#	attempt to do work on one package directory simultaneously.
#
#	Possible values:
#	* none: No locking takes place at all.
#	* once: When the lock has already been aquired by another
#	  process, the current process is terminated.
#	* sleep: When the lock has already been acquired by another
#	  process, the current process will sleep for PKGSRC_SLEEPSECS
#	  seconds and then try again.
#
#	You should also set OBJHOSTNAME when you are using the same
#	copy of pkgsrc on different hosts, maybe via NFS. This is because
#	the locking process writes its process ID into the lockfile,
#	and process IDs on different hosts are unrelated.
#
#	See also: LOCALBASE_LOCKTYPE, WRKDIR_LOCKTYPE.
#
#	Keywords: lock locking parallel
#

PKGSRC_SLEEPSECS?= 5
#	The number of seconds to wait when PKGSRC_LOCKTYPE is sleep.
#
#	Possible values: any positive integer
#

# The following values are used to manage the packages collection as a whole.
#

#ABI=
# The Application Binary Interface (ABI) to be used, if supported by the
# Operating System and/or compiler.
#
# Only change this if you really know what you're doing -- libraries of
# one ABI can not be linked with libraries of another!
#
# Currently only usable on IRIX or Solaris. On IRIX, it is set
# automatically by the bootstrap script, on Solaris, it is not.
#
# If you change it, be sure that _all_ the installed libraries and
# programs have the same API and use consistent compiler options. It is
# recommended that this variable be only changed directly after
# bootstrapping pkgsrc.
#
# Possible values:
#	* 64 (64 bit ABI; both IRIX or Solaris)
#	* 32 (SGI's N32 ABI; only IRIX)
#	* undefined (SGI's old o32 ABI; only IRIX)
#
# Default: undefined, but see above.

#PKG_DEVELOPER=	yes
#
# If defined and not "no" it enables some sanity checks to raise the quality
# of the installed packages. See the files pkgsrc/mk/check/check-*.mk for
# details and further configuration options.
#
# Possible: defined, not defined, no
# Default: not defined

USE_ABI_DEPENDS?=	yes
# Honor package prerequisite ABI recommendations.  If this is set
# to "yes", all entries in ABI_DEPENDS will be added to DEPENDS.

# are possibly ignored.
#
# WARNING: This should only be changed if you know what you're doing.
# Please read pkgsrc/doc/pkgsrc.txt for details.

# built and behave)
# Possible: "yes", not "yes"
# Default: "yes"

PKGSRC_RUN_TEST?=	no
#
# Many packages bring their own self tests to ensure they basically
# work. To run these tests after building a package, set this variable
# to "yes".
#
# Note: Some packages make heavy use of the random number generator in
# their tests, so need to make sure that there are always enough random
# numbers on your machine. The package security/bitstir may help here.
#
# Possible: yes, no
# Default: no
