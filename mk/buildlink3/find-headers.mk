# This is a "subroutine" that can be included to detect the presence of
# header files in the base system.
#
# The following variables must be defined before including this file:
#
#    BUILTIN_FIND_HEADERS_VAR is a list of variables to define.  These
#	variables take the value of the path to the file that is
#	"found".
#
#    BUILTIN_FIND_HEADERS.<var> is the list of header files to find, in
#	order, on the ${BUILTIN_INCLUDE_DIRS}.  The variable <var> is set
#	to the first path "found" on the filesystem.
#
# Optionally, the following variables may also be defined:
#
#    BUILTIN_FIND_GREP.<var> is a regular expression that must be
#	matched within a file in order for the file to be considered
#	"found".  If it isn't defined, then we simply check for the
#	existence of the file.
#
# After including this file, the following variables are defined:
#
#    <var> is the first of the header files listed in
#	${BUILTIN_FIND_HEADERS.<var>} that is "found" in
#	${BUILTIN_INCLUDE_DIRS}, or else it is "__nonexistent__".
#
# An example use is:
#
# BUILTIN_FIND_HEADERS_VAR:=	FOO BAR
#
# BUILTIN_FIND_HEADERS.FOO=	header1.h header2.h
# BUILTIN_FIND_GREP.FOO=	\#define.*FOO
#
# BUILTIN_FIND_HEADERS.BAR=	header3.h header4.h
# .include "../../mk/buildlink3/builtin-files.mk"
