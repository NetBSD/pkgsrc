# NAME
#	reduce-depends.awk -- reduce a list of dependencies
#
# SYNOPSIS
#	reduce-depends.awk "depends_list"
#
# DESCRIPTION
#	reduce-depends.awk removes some extraneous dependencies from the
#	dependency list.  The dependency list should be passed as a single
#	argument, and the output will be a list of the reduced dependencies,
#	echo one on a new line.
#
# ENVIRONMENT
#	CAT
#	PKG_ADMIN
#	PWD_CMD
#	TEST
