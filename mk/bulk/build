usage () {
	cat <<EOF
usage: $0 [options]
       $0 -h | --help

Runs a bulk pkgsrc build.

The following options are supported:

   -c | --config <file>
	Load the following configuration file instead of the default
	one.

   -e | --no-email
	Don't send email when the bulk build is finished.

   -h | --help
	Displays this message.

   -m | --mirror_only
	Downloads all distfiles needed for the build but does not run
	the build.  IMPORTANT:  Note that this will still run all the
	pre-build stuff which involves removing all of your installed
	packages.

	The only difference between this option and a regular bulk build
	is that the packages are not actually built.

   -p | --post-build
        Run the post-build processing and generate the report only.

   --prepare
        Only generate the package database that will be used when bulk
        building the packages.

   -r | --resume
	Resume a previously interrupted bulk build.

	The --resume option may be combined with the --mirror_only
	option.

   -s | --specific-pkgs
	Sets SPECIFIC_PKGS=1 when building packages.  This option is
	used for building a subset of pkgsrc.
