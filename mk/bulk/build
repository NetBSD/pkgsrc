usage: $0 [options]
       $0 -h | --help

Runs a bulk pkgsrc build.

The following options are supported:

   -c | --config <file>
	Load the following configuration file instead of the default
	one.

   -e | --no-email
	Don't send email when the bulk build is finished.

   -h | --help
	Displays this message.

   -m | --mirror_only
	Downloads all distfiles needed for the build but does not run
	the build.  IMPORTANT:  Note that this will still run all the
	pre-build stuff which involves removing all of your installed
	packages.

	The only difference between this option and a regular bulk build
	is that the packages are not actually built.

   -r | --restart | --resume | restart
	Restart a previously interrupted bulk build.  The last form of
	this option is for backwards compatibility and may be removed in
	future versions of this script.

	The --restart option may be combined with the --mirror_only
	option.

   -s | --specific-pkgs
	Sets SPECIFIC_PKGS=1 when building packages.  This option is
	used for building a subset of pkgsrc.
