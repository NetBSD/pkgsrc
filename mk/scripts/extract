# NAME
#	extract -- extract distfile, regardless of format
#
# SYNOPSIS
#	extract [-t tarprog] [-x] distfile [file ...]
#
# DESCRIPTION
#	extract will unpack the contents of the named distfile into the
#	current working directory.  If any optional files are specified
#	then only they will be extracted from the distfile, provided that
#	the underlying tool supports this ability.  If the -x option is
#	specified, then the optional files are excluded from extraction
#	instead.
#
# OPTIONS
#	-t tarprog	This specifies the tool to use to extract tar/ustar
#			archives, and may be either "tar" or "pax", or the
#			full path to the program.
#
#	-x		This causes the optional files listed on the
#			command line to be excluded from extraction,
#			provided the underlying tool supports this
#			ability.
#
# ENVIRONMENT
#	EXTRACT_OPTS_LHA
#	EXTRACT_OPTS_RAR
#	EXTRACT_OPTS_PAX
#	EXTRACT_OPTS_TAR
#	EXTRACT_OPTS_ZIP
#	EXTRACT_OPTS_ZOO
#		These variables set additional arguments passed to the
#		underlying extraction tool to unpack their respective
#		archive formats.
