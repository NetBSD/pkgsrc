# NAME
#	pkg_path -- canonicalize directories into "package paths"
#
# SYNOPSIS
#	pkg_path [-s pkgsrcdir] dir ...
#
# OPTIONS
#	The following command line arguments are supported.
#
#	-s pkgsrcdir	Use the specified directory as the path to the
#			pkgsrc directory tree.  By default, this is the
#			value stored in the PKGSRCDIR environment variable.
#
# DESCRIPTION
#	pkg_path canonicalizes the specified directories into package
#	paths that are relative to the pkgsrc directory tree, and prints
#	each of them to standard output on a new line.  The specified
#	directories are taken to be relative to the current directory.
#	Directories that are not valid package directories or are not
#	found are skipped during processing.
#
# ENVIRONMENT
#	PKGSRCDIR	This is the location of the pkgsrc directory tree,
#			which defaults to "/usr/pkgsrc".
