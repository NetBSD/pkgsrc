#
# This procedure determines the PKG_OPTIONS that have been in effect
# when the package ${pkgbase} has been built. When the package is not
# yet installed, its current PKG_OPTIONS are queried.
#
# Parameters:
#	pkgbase
#		The package identifier, as in the package's buildlink3.mk
#		file.
#
# Returns:
#	PKG_BUILD_OPTIONS.${pkgbase}
#		The build options of the package.
#
# Example:
#	# in emulators/wine/options.mk
#	pkgbase := wine
#	.include "../../mk/pkg-build-options.mk"
#
# Keywords: options pkg-build-options PKG_BUILD_OPTIONS
#
