You can run the X11 NetHack by typing "nethack x11".

Two fonts were installed for NetHack.  You must add
${PREFIX}/share/fonts/X11/misc to fontpath and set one of

NetHack*map*font: nh10
NetHack*map*font: -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal-ibmpc-14-120-75-75-c-80-iso8859-1

in ${PREFIX}/lib/X11/app-defaults/NetHack to use it.
Tiled mode is enabled by:

NetHack.tile_file: x11tiles

Also see ${PREFIX}/share/nethackdir340/nethack.x11.rc

You may also want to set this environment variable, so NetHack can
find its app-defaults file:

XFILESEARCHPATH=%D:/usr/pkg/lib/X11/%T/%N%C:/usr/pkg/lib/X11/%T/%N

To fall back to tty mode, use "NETHACKOPTIONS=windowtype:tty nethack"
or set that option in your .nethackrc file.
