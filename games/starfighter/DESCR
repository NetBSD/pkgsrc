Project: Starfighter is an old school 2D shoot 'em up. In the game you 
take on the role of a rebel pilot called Chris, who is attempting to
overthrow a military corporation called Weapco. Weapco has seized control
of the known universe and currently rules it with an iron fist. Chris can
no longer stand back and watch as millions of people suffer and die. He
steals an experimental craft known as "Firefly" and begins his mission to
fight his way to Sol, freeing key systems along the way. The game opens
with Chris attempting to escape a Weapco patrol that has intercepted him.
