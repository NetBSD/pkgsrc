Julius is a fully working open-source version of Caesar 3, with the same
logic as the original, but with some UI enhancements, that can be played on
multiple platforms.

Caesar III is a city-building game released in 1998.  Players assume the
role of a provincial governor to build thriving cities across the Roman
Empire, in which they must ensure their citizens have their needs met, and
deal with various disasters, angry gods and hostile enemies.

Julius will not run without the original Caesar 3 files. You can buy a
digital copy from GOG or Steam, or you can use an original CD-ROM version.

The goal of the project is to have exactly the same game logic as Caesar 3,
with the same look and feel. This means that the saved games are 100%
compatible with Caesar 3, and any gameplay bugs present in the original
Caesar 3 game will also be present in Julius.
