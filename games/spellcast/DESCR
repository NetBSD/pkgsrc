Spellcast is a multiplayer strategy game for Unix machines running X 
windows. 

It concerns a conflict between two or more powerful wizards. The opponents
use mystical hand gestures to invoke their spells -- spells of summoning,
elemental energy, protection, psionic influence, and good old-fashioned
brute force. Each wizard has two hands, a sequence of gestures can contain
multiple spells, and some spells require two-handed gestures.  This means
that timing and forethought are necessary to insure that your defensive
spells block all attacks while your attacks get through.
