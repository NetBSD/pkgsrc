DOOM is a lightning-fast virtual reality adventure where you're the
toughest space trooper ever to suck vacuum. Your mission is to shoot
your way through a monster-infested holocaust. Living to tell the tale if
possible. 

The gameplay for DOOM is quite simple. This is not a cumbersome
adventure game, but an action-oriented slugathon. You don't need the
reflexes of a hyperactive eight-year-old to win, either--using your wits is
IMPORTANT. To escape DOOM, you need both brains and the killer
instinct.
