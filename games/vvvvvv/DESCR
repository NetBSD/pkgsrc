VVVVVV is a platform game all about exploring one simple mechanical idea -
what if you reversed gravity instead of jumping?

The game is designed not to artificially gate your progress. In VVVVVV there
are no locks, no power-ups, no switches, nothing to stop you progressing
except the challenges themselves.
