$NetBSD: patch-al,v 1.1 2010/02/14 08:17:12 dholland Exp $

DESTDIR support.

XXX: I've disabled the chown/chgrp because as things previously were,
XXX: it had no effect.
XXX: 
XXX: It was installing the data files as 644/755 games.bin, while the
XXX: program was installed setgid games because we patched things that
XXX: way. Installing the files with the pkgsrc default ownership will
XXX: not change the behavior (no write permission).
XXX: 
XXX: However, it is likely wrong and someone needs to wade in and find
XXX: out if these things really need to be writeable, and if so figure
XXX: out the best way to arrange that. SPECIAL_PERMS for all these files
XXX: (there are a lot) won't be pretty.
