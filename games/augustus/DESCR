Augustus is a fork of the Julius project that intends to incorporate
customizable gameplay changes and enhancements to Caesar 3.

Caesar III is a city-building game released in 1998.  Players assume the
role of a provincial governor to build thriving cities across the Roman
Empire, in which they must ensure their citizens have their needs met, and
deal with various disasters, angry gods and hostile enemies.

Because of gameplay changes and additions, save files from Augustus are NOT
compatible with Caesar 3 or Julius. Augustus is able to load Caesar 3 save
files, but not the other way around. If you want vanilla experience with
visual and UI improvements, or want to use save files in base Caesar 3,
check Julius.

Augustus, like Julius, requires the original assets (graphics, sounds, etc)
from Caesar 3 to run, such as the version from Steam, GOG.com, or the
original CD-ROM.

Augustus optionally supports the high-quality MP3 files once provided on the
Sierra website.
