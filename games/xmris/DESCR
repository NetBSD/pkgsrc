Mr Is is a version of the Mr Do video arcade game for the X Window System. 

You control a gnome, who can walk around a garden, along paths already
marked, or create new paths wherever you wish. You also have a ball, which
can be thrown in the direction you're facing, towards the gnome's feet.
Points are scored for collecting cherries (if you collect eight cherries
without stopping or pushing an apple, you get a bonus), killing monsters
(by squashing them, or throwing the ball at them), and collecting the
prize left when all the monsters have come out of their den.
