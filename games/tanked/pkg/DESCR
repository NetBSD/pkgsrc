Get Tanked uses a client-server model, which means once you have a client
compiled, you need a server to play on. The server source is included, so
you can compile your own. Or you can play on ogesoft.dyn.ml.org, which is
run by the author of Get Tanked (that's me!). With v0.90,
ogresoft.dyn.ml.org is the default server in the client, so if you start
it with no arguments, you will be connected to it automatically. 

Once you are connected, you will see an MOTD window with server
information and basic instructions. From there, click either the red or
blue box at the top to select a team. This will put you in a tank at the
HQ for that team. The object is capture all of the other team's flags by
running over them to pick them up, and then bring them back to your HQ.
You have mines and shells for weapons, and the ability to build roads,
walls, and bridges. You may hide in wooded areas, but you move much faster
over roads.
