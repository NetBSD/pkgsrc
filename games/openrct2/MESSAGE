After starting OpenRCT2 it will ask you to set `game_path` to an installed
game's data files in ~/.config/OpenRCT2/config.ini

The data files can be extracted from the data1.cab and data2.cab files on
the original installation media with `unshield`. This will create a
directory called `Minimum` containing the game data. `game_path` should be
set to the full path of `Minimum`.

If you have the DRM-free digital version instead of the physical version,
`innoextract` can be used to extract the data files from it. They are
located in the root of the `app` directory. `game_path` should be set to
the full path of the `app` directory.
