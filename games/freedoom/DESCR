The Freedoom project aims to create a complete free content first
person shooter game. But Freedoom by itself is just the raw material
for a game: it must be paired with a compatible game engine to be
played.

id Software released the source code to their classic game, Doom, under
the GNU General Public License. This means that the program code that
powers Doom is free; Freedoom complements this with free levels, artwork,
sound effects and music to make a completely free game.

Freedoom is actually three games in one, consisting of two single
player campaigns and one set of levels intended for multiplayer
deathmatch (FreeDM).

Note: This package contains no game engine, only the data (wad) files.
