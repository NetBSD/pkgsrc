Crossfire is a multi-player graphical arcade and adventure game.

It has certain flavours from other games, especially gauntlet and the
rogue-like games (Nethack, Moria, Angband, and Ragnarok.) Any number of
players can move around in their own window, finding and using items and
battling monsters. They can choose to cooperate or compete in the same world.

In the years of development that have followed, Crossfire has grown to
encompass over 150 monsters, ~3000 maps to explore, an elaborate magic
system, over 15 character types, a system of skills, and many, many artifacts
and treasures.
