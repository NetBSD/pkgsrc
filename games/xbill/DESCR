       Ever  get the feeling that nothing is going right?  You're
       a sysadmin, and someone's trying to destroy  your  comput-
       ers.  The little people running around the screen are try-
       ing to infect your computers with Wingdows [TM],  a  virus
       cleverly  designed to resemble a popular operating system.
       Your objective is to click the mouse on them, ending their
       potential  threat.  If one of the people reaches a comput-
       er, it will attempt to replace your operating system  with
       the  virus it carries. It will then attempt to run off the
       screen with your vital software.  The game ends when  only
       0 or 1 of your computers is being productive.  Additional-
       ly, some computers  are  connected  with  network  cables.
       When  one  computer on a network becomes infected, a spark
       will be sent down the cable, and will infect the  computer
       on the other end when it reaches there.
