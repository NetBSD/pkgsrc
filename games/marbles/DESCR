I always liked the game Atomix and wanted to write a clone for Linux.
But some guys had this idea before me so I slightly changed the
concept from assembling molecules to creating figures out of single
marbles. Nevertheless, the basic game play is the same: If a marble
starts to move it will not stop until it hits a wall or marble.
And to make it even more interesting there are obstacles like one-way
streets, crumbling walls and portals.

As Marbles is meant as a puzzle game you play against a move limit and
not a time limit. This way you have as much time as you need to think.
Marbles has a menu to configure graphics (fullscreen, animations),
sounds and gameplay (player name, levelset, difficulty).
