In a nutshell, Nighthawk is a shoot-'em up game, however, it requires
alot of lateral thinking. If you go around blasting everything to
pieces, you'll find that you won't last very long as you're up
again droids with far greater fire power than yourself. The droids
are fairly stupid compared to a human though, so you have that in
your favour.

You are a droid and you have to destroy droids occupying a fleet
of reclaimed starships. You start out as a 002 Paradroid with very
poor firepower and shielding.  However, you have the ability to
transfer your programs over to a new droid, effectively taking it
over. As you take control of bigger and better droids, you''ll gain
better firepower and shielding.
