Knights is a graphical chess interface to various chess engines and is
designed to work with KDE2.  It has features geared toward novice players,
such as "previews": when you right click on a piece, Knights will show you
where that piece can move, and where it can attack.  Future releases of
Knights will include tutorials which teach everything from piece movement
to advanced endgame strategy.
