OpenJK requires the original game files from Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Jedi
Academy to be useful.

If using the GOG version, you must extract the files from the setup exe
using the innoextract package.

The files will be in a directory named app. Inside the app directory, there
is a GameData directory. Inside the GameData directory, there is a directory
named base. This base directory must be moved to ~/.local/share/openjk
