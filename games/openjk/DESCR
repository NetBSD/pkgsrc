OpenJK is an effort by the JACoders group to maintain and improve the game
engine on which the Star Wars: Jedi Academy game runs on, while maintaining
full backwards compatibility with the existing game. This project does not
attempt to rebalance or otherwise modify core gameplay.

You will need a copy of Jedi Academy to play OpenJK.
