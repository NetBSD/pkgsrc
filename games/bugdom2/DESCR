It has been three years since Rollie McFly rid the Bugdom of the evil King
Thorax and his minions, but the Bugdom can still be dangerous place as our
new hero Skip is about to find out. While on his way to visit his family on
the far side of the Bugdom, a Bully Bee swooped down and stole Skipâ€™s
knapsack. Your job as Skip is to track down the Bully Bee and get your
knapsack back.

Bugdom 2 was released in 2002 by Pangea Software as a Mac game. It is the
sequel to the original Bugdom.
