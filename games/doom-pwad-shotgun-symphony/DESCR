Attention: This is a mod for Doom, not a standalone game!
It has received one of the 2019 Cacowards on Doomworld.

For the look & feel intended by the author, you need the original Doom or
Ultimate Doom from id Software as base (doom.wad or doomu.wad as IWAD).
If you don't have Doom, you can use Freedoom (freedoom1.wad as IWAD) to
play, but the Freedoom graphics doesn't match well to the style of this mod.

Advanced engine needed  : Boom Compatible
Primary purpose         : Single play
===========================================================================

You have received orders to investigate the giant UAC complex on Phobos.
Expect extreme enemy resistence from the moment you arrive. They are waiting
for you. You will find a new and powerful enemy caged in the final stage
of the first complex. Do not try to kill it. Instead, journey through
later stages of the vast, interconnected facility. We believe you can find
a way to attack it from behind, when you have stronger weapons.
