Attention: This is a mod for Doom II, not a standalone game!
It has received one of the 2019 Cacowards on Doomworld.

For the look & feel intended by the author, you need the original Doom II
from id Software as base (doom2.wad as IWAD).
If you don't have Doom II, you can use Freedoom (freedoom2.wad as IWAD) to
play, but the Freedoom graphics doesn't match well to the style of this mod.

===========================================================================
Advanced engine needed  : PrBoom+ or GZdoom [Doom Legacy seems to work too]
Primary purpose         : Single + coop play
===========================================================================

Eviternity's six chapters explore a series of
unique and varied themes, each featuring classic
gameplay with an interest in making each map hold
its own unique identity and personality. The
themes are "Medieval", "Techbase", "Icy Castles",
"Industrial / Brutalism", "Hell / Gore / Alien" and
"Heaven".
