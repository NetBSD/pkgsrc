Battalion was a game written in 1994 on a Silicon Graphics Indy in GL for
the IndiZone contest. This version also ran in the CAVE(tm) as a virtual
reality game at the EVE 4 art show in May 1995. The GL version won 'best
indy software' and is available on the Indizone3 CDROM. It was then
converted to OpenGL (with several enhancements) and modified in late 1996
to work with the Mesa graphics library. In 1997 it won the Hot Mix 17 game
contest from SGI, and was availableon the Hot Mix 17 CDROM. 

Here is the description of battalion from the Silicon Graphics homepage 
in Japan. 
                                                                        
        Battalion wa 'kaiju ga bakuhatsu, hakai' wo kuri-kaesu game desu. 
        Battalion is a game where 'A monster blows up, destroys' repeats. 
... pretty much says it all ...
