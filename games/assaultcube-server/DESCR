AssaultCube is a FREE, multiplayer, first-person shooter game,
based on the CUBE engine.

Taking place in realistic environments, with fast, arcade gameplay,
it's addictive and fun!

With efficient bandwidth usage, it's low-latency and can even run
over a 56 Kbps connection.  It's tiny too, weighing in at a
lightweight about 50 MB package available for Windows, Mac and
Linux.  On the correct settings, it can even run on old hardware
(Pentium III and above).

This package only contains the server software.
