.SH DESCRIPTION

The following information is quoted from Reference Manual:

.PP

Doom Legacy can play Doom, Boom, Marine's Best Friend (MBF), and Heretic maps.
In addition to the original games by id Software and Raven Software, there are
hundreds of free, fan-made maps available on the Internet. These maps are
typically distributed as PWAD files, which are not fully self-contained.
For each game you will also need the corresponding IWAD data file, which
contains all the graphics, wall and floor textures, sounds, and music for that
game. For example, if you want to play Doom II maps, you'll need the IWAD file
doom2.wad, or one of the free replacements.

Legacy has implemented the fundamental and de-facto-standard Boom extensions,
and the Marine's Best Friend (MBF) extensions. Legacy also has implemented
among other things 3D floors, swimmable water and other special effects using
extended linedef codes, and supports the FraggleScript scripting language.

Legacy includes two different graphics engines, the old Doom software renderer
(with many improvements) and an OpenGL-based hardware renderer.
The OpenGL renderer is shinier and has fancier effects than the software one,
but it does not do everything that the software renderer does. It does have
coronas, explosion light, and other light effects that the software renderer
does not do.
Some wads rely upon violating wad rules to get trick effects. Most rely upon
tricking the software renderer into not drawing something. Using those wads
with the OpenGL renderer you will see holes in the floor and ceiling, and
warning messges about polygons.

The first game console we know of was from id Software's game Quake.
We have been inspired by it and have tried to implement the same functionality
for the benefit of Quake/Doom fans.

Since Legacy 1.2, the network part of Doom has been totally rewritten.
It now uses a better transfer method for the packets, (which is usually faster),
and also implements a basic Client/Server model, where some critical game
options are changeable only by the server in multiplayer games. Since the
network communication is faster, we have upped the maximum number of players to
32!

.\" OPTIONS section
.\"
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 25
.BI -config " file
Set the configfile to use.
.br
Default: config.cfg
.TP
.BI -deh " file [file ...]
Load one or more DEH (DeHackEd) files or BEX files, which can change monster
abilities and game text.
.TP
.BI -dehthing " name
Supported DEH translations: legacy, boom, prboom, ee.
.TP
.BI -file " file [file ...]
Set PWAD (Patch WAD) files to use.
.TP
.BI -game " mode
Forces a particular game mode to be used.
.br
Examples for mode: doom, doomu, doom2, heretic
.br
(See Reference Manual for complete table)
.TP
.BI -h " [section]
Print help. An optional section can be specified for details.
.TP
.BI -home " directory
Home directory location, where your configfiles and savegames are kept.
.TP
.BI -iwad " file
Set the main IWAD (Internal WAD) file to use.
This also determines the game mode when -game is not used.
.TP
.BI -noendtext
Suppress the game EndText screen, which could disrupt some terminal emulations
because of the special character attributes used.
.PP
.RS 25
For encoding of EndText data see config.cfg file entry textout.
Supported values: Off, Vanilla, UTF8.
.RE
.TP 25
.BI -opengl
Hardware accelerated rendering using the OpenGL library.
Will use hardware acceleration for OpenGL if available.
If the video card does not have OpenGL hardware acceleration then it will use
the OpenGL emulation in software, which is very slow.
.TP
.BI --version
Print version and build date.
.TP
.BI -warp " num
Select the map, start game immediately.
.br
In DoomII, -warp 13 will goto MAP13.
.br
In Ultimate Doom, -warp 1 3 will goto E1M3.
.TP
See Reference Manual for a complete options list.

If you get no MIDI music, ensure that SDL_mixer has a working MIDI synthesizer
available. If you use timidity, check that instruments are installed (e.g.
freepats).

Start the shareware Episode 1 of Doom:
.IP
$ $NAME
.PP
For the following examples you need the original WAD files of the games
(copy them to $WADDIR or set DOOMWADDIR to the desired location).

Start Doom and use the OpenGL renderer:
.IP
$ $NAME -opengl -iwad doom.wad
.PP
Start Doom II:
.IP
$ $NAME -iwad doom2.wad
.PP
Start Sigil (Doom Episode 5) in compatibility mode as Episode 3:
.IP
$ $NAME -game doomu -iwad doomu.wad -file SIGIL_COMPAT.wad
.PP
Start Heretic:
.IP
$ $NAME -iwad heretic.wad
