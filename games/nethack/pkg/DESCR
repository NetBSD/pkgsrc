Nethack is a single player, ASCII graphics-based adventure game, similar
to the lines of Dungeons & Dragons and similar fantasy games. It is
commonly classified in the larger group of Rogue-like Games, which
generally are all text-based, solo adventures. 

Within the game, your character is after the infamous Wizard of Yendor,
who has stolen the Amulet of Yendor and plans to use it for his evil
purposes. You, a young member of your chosen class, have been blessed by
your people and your god to retrieve the Amulet, and to save the world
from the Wizard's evil plans.

This pkg installs the X11, QT and tty based versions of the game. You may
also choose to install just one or more by themselves.
