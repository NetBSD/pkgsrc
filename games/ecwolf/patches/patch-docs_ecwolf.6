+.SH NAME
+ecwolf - Advanced Wolfenstein 3D source port
+
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+.B ecwolf
+[\fIoptions\fR] [\fIfiles\fR ...]
+
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+.B ecwolf
+is an advanced source port of the Wolfenstein 3D engine based upon Wolf4SDL
+with some back ports from ZDoom. It provides substantially boosted capabilities
+for creating mods without requiring source code edits using scripting and other
+tools familiar to users of ZDoom.
+
+For players it offers modern features such as support for modern control
+schemes and wide screen. Being based on the Wolfenstein 3D engine and using an
+enhanced version of the original software renderer, it provides a relatively
+accurate play experience to vanilla while modernizing.
+
+Currently supported games are Wolfenstein 3D, Spear of Destiny, and Super 3-D
+Noah's Ark.
+
+.SH OPTIONS
+Use the --help option for a complete list of options.
+

+the extensions *.n3d, *.sod, *.sd2, *.sd3, *.wl1, or *.wl6. They should be
