ECWolf is an advanced source port of the Wolfenstein 3D engine based upon
Wolf4SDL with some back ports from ZDoom. It provides substantially boosted
capabilities for creating mods without requiring source code edits using
scripting and other tools familiar to users of ZDoom.

For players it offers modern features such as support for modern control
schemes and wide screen. Being based on the Wolfenstein 3D engine and using an
enhanced version of the original software renderer, it provides a relatively
accurate play experience to vanilla while modernizing.

Currently supported games are Wolfenstein 3D, Spear of Destiny, and Super 3-D
Noah's Ark.

The original game data files are required for operation. These are files with
the extensions *.n3d, *.sod, *.sd2, *.sd3, *.wl1, or *.wl6.
