Clonk is a multiplayer-action-tactics-skill game. It is often referred to as a
mixture of The Settlers and Worms. In a simple 2D antfarm-style landscape, the
player controls their crew of Clonks, small but robust humanoid beings. The
game encourages free play but the normal goal is to either exploit valuable
resources from the earth by building a mine or fight each other on an
arena-like map.
