You can run Falcon's Eye NetHack by simply typing: "falcons-eye"

To configure music and sound effects, run ${PREFIX}/bin/fe-config, or
simply edit the text files in ${PREFIX}/share/falcons-eye-dir/config/

If the sound effects sound like static noise, try giving SDL a hint.
For example: export AUDIODEV=/dev/sound0
