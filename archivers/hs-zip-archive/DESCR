The zip-archive library provides functions for creating, modifying,
and extracting files from zip archives. The zip archive format is
documented in http://www.pkware.com/documents/casestudies/APPNOTE.TXT.

Certain simplifying assumptions are made about the zip archives: in
particular, there is no support for strong encryption, zip files that
span multiple disks, ZIP64, OS-specific file attributes, or
compression methods other than Deflate. However, the library should be
able to read the most common zip archives, and the archives it
produces should be readable by all standard unzip programs.
