NuLib is a disk and file archive program, similar in principle to PKZIP.  
Instead of ZIP archives, it manipulates NuFX archives, which are usually
identified with ".SHK", ".SDK", or ".BXY".

The ".SHK" file extension is derived from ShrinkIt, the de facto
archiving standard for Apple II computers.
