1mNAME0m
       archive_write_data,  archive_write_data_block  — functions for creating
       archives

1mLIBRARY0m
       Streaming Archive Library (libarchive, -larchive)

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1m#include <archive.h>0m

       4mla_ssize_t0m
       1marchive_write_data22m(4mstruct24m 4marchive24m 4m*24m, 4mconst24m 4mvoid24m 4m*24m, 4msize_t24m);

       4mla_ssize_t0m
       1marchive_write_data_block22m(4mstruct24m 4marchive24m 4m*24m, 4mconst24m 4mvoid24m 4m*24m,  4msize_t24m	 4msize24m,
	   4mint64_t24m 4moffset24m);

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       1marchive_write_data22m()
	       Write data corresponding to the header just written.

       1marchive_write_data_block22m()
	       Write  data  corresponding to the header just written.  This is
	       like 1marchive_write_data22m() except that it performs a seek on the
	       file being written to the specified offset before  writing  the
	       data.   This is useful when restoring sparse files from archive
	       formats that support sparse files.   Returns  number  of	 bytes
	       written or -1 on error.	(Note: This is currently not supported
	       for archive_write handles, only for archive_write_disk handles.

1mRETURN VALUES0m
       This  function returns the number of bytes actually written, or a nega‐
       tive error code on error.

1mERRORS0m
       Detailed error codes and textual descriptions are  available  from  the
       1marchive_errno22m() and 1marchive_error_string22m() functions.

1mBUGS0m
       In  libarchive 3.x, this function sometimes returns zero on success in‐
       stead of returning the number of bytes written.	Specifically, this oc‐
       curs when writing to  an	 4marchive_write_disk24m  handle.   Clients  should
       treat  any  value less than zero as an error and consider any non-nega‐
       tive value as success.
