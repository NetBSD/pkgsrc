1mDESCRIPTION0m
       1marchive_read_next_header22m()
	       Read the header for the next entry and return a	pointer	 to  a

	       archive_entry object for each request.

	       Read  the  header  for the next entry and populate the provided
	       struct archive_entry.

       countered), 1mARCHIVE_EOF 22m(end-of-archive was encountered), 1mARCHIVE_RETRY0m
       (the operation failed but can be retried), and 1mARCHIVE_FATAL 22m(there was
