1mDESCRIPTION0m
       These functions create and manipulate data objects that	represent  en‐
       tries  within an archive.  You can think of a struct archive_entry as a
       heavy-duty version of struct stat: it includes everything  from	struct
       stat  plus  associated  pathname,  textual  group  and user names, etc.
       These objects are used by 4mlibarchive24m(3) to represent the metadata asso‐
       ciated with a particular entry in an archive.

   1mCreate and Destroy0m
       There are functions to allocate, destroy, clear, and copy 4marchive_entry0m
       objects:
       1marchive_entry_clear22m()
	       Erases the object, resetting all internal fields	 to  the  same
	       state as a newly-created object.	 This is provided to allow you
	       to quickly recycle objects without thrashing the heap.
       1marchive_entry_clone22m()
	       A deep copy operation; all text fields are duplicated.
       1marchive_entry_free22m()
	       Releases the struct archive_entry object.
       1marchive_entry_new22m()
	       Allocate and return a blank struct archive_entry object.

   1mFunction groups0m
       Due to high number of functions, the accessor functions can be found in
       man pages grouped by the purpose.

       4marchive_entry_acl24m(3)    Access Control List manipulation

       4marchive_entry_paths24m(3)  Path name manipulation

       4marchive_entry_perms24m(3)  User, group and mode manipulation

       4marchive_entry_stat24m(3)   Functions  not  in the other groups and copying
			       to/from 4mstruct24m 4mstat24m.

       4marchive_entry_time24m(3)   Time field manipulation

       Most of the functions set or read entries in an object.	Such functions
       have one of the following forms:
       1marchive_entry_set_XXXX22m()
	       Stores the provided data in the	object.	  In  particular,  for
	       strings, the pointer is stored, not the referenced string.
       1marchive_entry_copy_XXXX22m()
	       As  above,  except  that the referenced data is copied into the
	       object.
       1marchive_entry_XXXX22m()
	       Returns the specified data.  In the case of strings,  a	const-
	       qualified pointer to the string is returned.
       String  data can be set or accessed as wide character strings or normal
       4mchar24m strings.  The functions that use wide character strings  are  suf‐
       fixed  with  1m_w22m.   Note that these are different representations of the
       same data: For example, if you store a narrow string and read the  cor‐
       responding  wide	 string, the object will transparently convert formats
       using the current locale.  Similarly, if you store a  wide  string  and
       then  store  a narrow string for the same data, the previously-set wide
       string will be discarded in favor of the new data.
