1mDESCRIPTION0m
       These functions provide a way for libarchive clients to configure  spe‐
       cific read modules.

       1marchive_read_set_filter_option22m(), 1marchive_read_set_format_option22m()
	       Specifies an option that will be passed to currently-registered
	       filters (including decompression filters) or format readers.

	       If  4moption24m	and  4mvalue24m	 are  both NULL, these functions will do
	       nothing and 1mARCHIVE_OK 22mwill be returned.  If 4moption24m is NULL but
	       4mvalue24m  is  not,   these   functions	  will	 do   nothing	and
	       1mARCHIVE_FAILED 22mwill be returned.

	       If 4mmodule24m is not NULL, 4moption24m and 4mvalue24m will be provided to the
	       filter  or  reader named 4mmodule24m.  The return value will be that
	       of the module.  If there is no such module, 1mARCHIVE_FAILED 22mwill
	       be returned.

	       If 4mmodule24m is NULL, 4moption24m and 4mvalue24m will be provided  to	every
	       registered  module.   If any module returns 1mARCHIVE_FATAL22m, this
	       value will be returned immediately.  Otherwise, 1mARCHIVE_OK 22mwill
	       be  returned  if	  any	module	 accepts   the	 option,   and
	       1mARCHIVE_FAILED 22min all other cases.

       1marchive_read_set_option22m()
	       Calls	       1marchive_read_set_format_option22m(),	       then
	       1marchive_read_set_filter_option22m().  If either  function  returns
	       1mARCHIVE_FATAL22m,  1mARCHIVE_FATAL  22mwill  be  returned  immediately.
	       Otherwise, greater of the two values will be returned.

       1marchive_read_set_options22m()
	       4moptions24m is a comma-separated list of options.   If	4moptions24m  is
	       NULL or empty, 1mARCHIVE_OK 22mwill be returned immediately.

	       Calls  1marchive_read_set_option22m()  with each option in turn.	 If
	       any  1marchive_read_set_option22m()  call   returns   1mARCHIVE_FATAL22m,
	       1mARCHIVE_FATAL 22mwill be returned immediately.

	       Individual options have one of the following forms:
	       4moption=value0m
		       The option/value pair will be provided to every module.
		       Modules	that  do  not  accept an option with this name
		       will ignore it.
	       4moption24m  The option will be provided	 to  every  module  with  a
		       value of “1”.
	       4m!option0m
		       The option will be provided to every module with a NULL
		       value.
	       4mmodule:option=value24m, 4mmodule:option24m, 4mmodule:!option0m
		       As  above,  but the corresponding option and value will
		       be provided only to modules whose name matches 4mmodule24m.

1mOPTIONS0m
       Format cab
	       1mhdrcharset0m
		       The value is used as a character set name that will  be
		       used when translating file names.
       Format cpio
	       1mcompat-2x0m
		       Libarchive 2.x incorrectly encoded Unicode filenames on
		       some  platforms.	 This option mimics the libarchive 2.x
		       filename handling so that such  archives	 can  be  read
		       correctly.
	       1mhdrcharset0m
		       The  value is used as a character set name that will be
		       used when translating file names.
	       1mpwb	 22mWhen reading a binary CPIO archive, assume that  it	 is
		       in  the	original PWB cpio format, and handle file mode
		       bits accordingly.  The default is to assume v7 format.
       Format iso9660
	       1mjoliet	 22mSupport Joliet extensions.	Defaults  to  enabled,	use
		       1m!joliet 22mto disable.
	       1mrockridge0m
		       Support RockRidge extensions.  Defaults to enabled, use
		       1m!rockridge 22mto disable.
       Format lha
	       1mhdrcharset0m
		       The  value is used as a character set name that will be
		       used when translating file names.
       Format mtree
	       1mcheckfs0m
		       Allow reading information missing from the  mtree  from
		       the file system.	 Disabled by default.
       Format rar
	       1mhdrcharset0m
		       The  value is used as a character set name that will be
		       used when translating file names.
       Format tar
	       1mcompat-2x0m
		       Libarchive 2.x incorrectly encoded Unicode filenames on
		       some platforms.	This option mimics the libarchive  2.x
		       filename	 handling  so  that  such archives can be read
		       correctly.
	       1mhdrcharset0m
		       The value is used as a character set name that will  be
		       used when translating file names.
	       1mmac-ext0m
		       Support	Mac OS metadata extension that records data in
		       special files beginning with a period  and  underscore.
		       Defaults	 to enabled on Mac OS, disabled on other plat‐
		       forms.  Use 1m!mac-ext 22mto disable.
	       1mread_concatenated_archives0m
		       Ignore zeroed blocks in the archive, which occurs  when
		       multiple	 tar archives have been concatenated together.
		       Without this option, only the  contents	of  the	 first
		       concatenated archive would be read.
       Format zip
	       1mcompat-2x0m
		       Libarchive 2.x incorrectly encoded Unicode filenames on
		       some  platforms.	 This option mimics the libarchive 2.x
		       filename handling so that such  archives	 can  be  read
		       correctly.
	       1mhdrcharset0m
		       The  value is used as a character set name that will be
		       used when translating file names.
	       1mignorecrc320m
		       Skip the CRC32 check.  Mostly used for testing.
	       1mmac-ext0m
		       Support Mac OS metadata extension that records data  in
		       special	files  beginning with a period and underscore.
		       Defaults to enabled on Mac OS, disabled on other	 plat‐
		       forms.  Use 1m!mac-ext 22mto disable.
