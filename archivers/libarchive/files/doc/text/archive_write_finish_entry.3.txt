1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1m#include <archive.h>0m

       4mint0m
       1marchive_write_finish_entry22m(4mstruct24m 4marchive24m 4m*24m);

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       Close  out  the entry just written.  In particular, this writes out the
       final padding required by some formats.	Ordinarily, clients never need
       to call this, as it is called automatically  by	1marchive_write_header22m()
       and  1marchive_write_close22m()	as needed.  For archive_write_disk handles,
       this flushes pending file attribute changes like modification time.

1mRETURN VALUES0m
       This function returns 1mARCHIVE_OK 22mon success, or one of several non-zero
       error codes for errors.	Specific error	codes  include:	 1mARCHIVE_RETRY0m
       for  operations that might succeed if retried, 1mARCHIVE_WARN 22mfor unusual
       conditions that do not prevent further  operations,  and	 1mARCHIVE_FATAL0m
       for serious errors that make remaining operations impossible.

1mERRORS0m
       Detailed	 error	codes  and textual descriptions are available from the
       1marchive_errno22m() and 1marchive_error_string22m() functions.
