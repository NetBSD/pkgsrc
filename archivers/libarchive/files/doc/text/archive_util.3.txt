1mDESCRIPTION0m
       These functions provide access to various information about the	struct
       archive object used in the 4mlibarchive24m(3) library.
       1marchive_clear_error22m()
	       Clears  any  error  information left over from a previous call.
	       Not generally used in client code.
       1marchive_compression22m()
	       Synonym for 1marchive_filter_code22m(4ma24m, 4m024m).
       1marchive_compression_name22m()
	       Synonym for 1marchive_filter_name22m(4ma24m, 4m024m).
       1marchive_copy_error22m()
	       Copies error information from one archive to another.
       1marchive_errno22m()
	       Returns a numeric error code (see 4merrno24m(2)) indicating the rea‐
	       son for the most recent error return.  Note that this  can  not
	       be  reliably  used to detect whether an error has occurred.  It
	       should be used only after another libarchive function  has  re‐
	       turned an error status.
       1marchive_error_string22m()
	       Returns	a textual error message suitable for display.  The er‐
	       ror message here is usually more specific  than	that  obtained
	       from passing the result of 1marchive_errno22m() to 4mstrerror24m(3).
       1marchive_file_count22m()
	       Returns	a  count  of  the  number  of  files processed by this
	       archive	object.	  The  count  is  incremented  by   calls   to
	       4marchive_write_header24m(3) or 4marchive_read_next_header24m(3).
       1marchive_filter_code22m()
	       Returns	a  numeric code identifying the indicated filter.  See
	       1marchive_filter_count22m() for details of the numbering.
       1marchive_filter_count22m()
	       Returns the number of filters in	 the  current  pipeline.   For
	       read  archive handles, these filters are added automatically by
	       the automatic format detection.	 For  write  archive  handles,
	       these   filters	 are   added   by   calls   to	 the   various
	       1marchive_write_add_filter_XXX22m() functions.  Filters in  the	re‐
	       sulting	pipeline  are  numbered so that filter 0 is the filter
	       closest to the format handler.	As  a  convenience,  functions
	       that expect a filter number will accept -1 as a synonym for the
	       highest-numbered filter.

	       For  example,  when  reading  a	uuencoded gzipped tar archive,
	       there are three filters: filter 0 is the gunzip filter,	filter
	       1  is  the  uudecode  filter, and filter 2 is the pseudo-filter
	       that wraps the archive read functions.  In this case,  request‐
	       ing   1marchive_position22m(4ma24m,   4m-124m)	would	be   a	 synonym  for
	       1marchive_position22m(4ma24m, 4m224m) which would return the number  of	bytes
	       currently  read	from the archive, while 1marchive_position22m(4ma24m, 4m124m)
	       would  return  the  number  of  bytes  after  uudecoding,   and
	       1marchive_position22m(4ma24m,  4m024m)  would return the number of bytes after
	       decompression.
       1marchive_filter_name22m()
	       Returns a textual name identifying the indicated	 filter.   See
	       1marchive_filter_count22m() for details of the numbering.
       1marchive_format22m()
	       Returns	a  numeric  code  indicating the format of the current
	       archive entry.  This value is  set  by  a  successful  call  to
	       1marchive_read_next_header22m().	  Note	that  it is common for this
	       value to change from  entry  to	entry.	 For  example,	a  tar
	       archive	might have several entries that utilize GNU tar exten‐
	       sions and several entries that do not.  These entries will have
	       different format codes.
       1marchive_format_name22m()
	       A textual description of the format of the current entry.
       1marchive_position22m()
	       Returns the number of bytes read from or written to  the	 indi‐
	       cated  filter.	In  particular, 1marchive_position22m(4ma24m, 4m024m) returns
	       the number of bytes read or  written  by	 the  format  handler,
	       while  1marchive_position22m(4ma24m, 4m-124m) returns the number of bytes read
	       or written to the archive.  See 1marchive_filter_count22m() for	de‐
	       tails of the numbering here.
       1marchive_set_error22m()
	       Sets  the numeric error code and error description that will be
	       returned by 1marchive_errno22m() and  1marchive_error_string22m().   This
	       function should be used within I/O callbacks to set system-spe‐
	       cific  error  codes  and error descriptions.  This function ac‐
	       cepts a printf-like format string and arguments.	 However,  you
	       should be careful to use only the following printf format spec‐
	       ifiers:	“%c”,  “%d”, “%jd”, “%jo”, “%ju”, “%jx”, “%ld”, “%lo”,
	       “%lu”, “%lx”, “%o”, “%u”, “%s”, “%x”, “%%”.  Field-width speci‐
	       fiers and other printf features are not uniformly supported and
	       should not be used.
