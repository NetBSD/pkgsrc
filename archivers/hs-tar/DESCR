This library is for working with ".tar" archive files. It can read and
write a range of common variations of archive format including V7,
POSIX USTAR and GNU formats.

It provides support for packing and unpacking portable archives. This
makes it suitable for distribution but not backup because details like
file ownership and exact permissions are not preserved.

It also provides features for random access to archive content using
an index.
