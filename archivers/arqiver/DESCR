Arqiver is a simple Qt5 archive manager as a front-end for libarchive
(bsdtar), gzip and 7z.

	*Arqiver can extract, create and edit archives that are supported by its
	 back-ends.
	*It can open archives by drag-and-drop. Its listed items can be viewed
	 separately or dragged and dropped into appropriate applications.
	 With 7z, it also supports password protection.

Arqiver was started from lumina-archiver, belonging to Lumina
(<https://github.com/lumina-desktop/lumina>).
