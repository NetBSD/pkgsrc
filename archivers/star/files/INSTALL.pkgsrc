The location of the PKGNAME_NOREV `defaults' file has been set to:

   STAR_CONF

This is the pkgsrc standard config file location, NOT the PKGNAME_NOREV
standard location, which is /etc/default/star.

The reason for this is that pkgsrc packages should not use configuration
files outside ${LOCALBASE} unless they are explicitly set by the user.
