You should customise both the ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/sarab.dcf and
${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/sarab.conf configuration files to select the backup
location.  Default is "/mnt/backup/".

You should customise ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/rotation.schedule based on your backup
requirements.  Some example rotation files can be found under
${PREFIX}/share/examples/sarab.

SaraB backups are usually scheduled and executed by cron.  SaraB must be run
as root, and is generally run with no parameters.

E.g.

crontab -u root -l
# Daily backups at 3:13 AM
3 13 * * * ${PREFIX}/bin/sarab
