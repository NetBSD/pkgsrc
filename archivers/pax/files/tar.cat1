     The ttaarr command creates, adds files to, or extracts files from an archive
     file in ``tar'' format.  A tar archive is often stored on a magnetic
     tape, but can be stored equally well on a floppy, CD-ROM, or in a regular
     disk file.

     One of the following flags must be present:

     --cc, ----ccrreeaattee  Create new archive, or overwrite an existing archive,
                   adding the specified files to it.

     --rr, ----aappppeenndd  Append the named new files to existing archive.  Note that
                   this will only work on media on which an end-of-file mark
                   can be overwritten.

     --tt, ----lliisstt    List contents of archive.  If any files are named on the
                   command line, only those files will be listed.

     --uu, ----uuppddaattee  Alias for --rr.

     --xx, ----eexxttrraacctt, ----ggeett
                   Extract files from archive.  If any files are named on the
                   command line, only those files will be extracted from the
                   archive.  If more than one copy of a file exists in the
                   archive, later copies will overwrite earlier copies during
                   extraction.  The file mode and modification time are pre-
                   served if possible.  The file mode is subject to modifica-
                   tion by the umask(2).

     In addition to the flags mentioned above, any of the following flags may
     be used:

     --bb _b_l_o_c_k_i_n_g _f_a_c_t_o_r, ----bblloocckk--ssiizzee _b_l_o_c_k_i_n_g _f_a_c_t_o_r
                   Set blocking factor to use for the archive.  ttaarr uses 512
                   byte blocks.  The default is 20, the maximum is 126.
                   Archives with a blocking factor larger 63 violate the POSIX
                   standard and will not be portable to all systems.

     --ee            Stop after first error.

     --ff _a_r_c_h_i_v_e, ----ffiillee _a_r_c_h_i_v_e
                   Filename where the archive is stored.  Defaults to
                   _/_d_e_v_/_r_s_t_0.  If the archive is of the form:
                   _[_[_u_s_e_r_@_]_h_o_s_t_:_]_f_i_l_e then the archive will be processed using
                   rmt(8).

     --hh, ----ddeerreeffeerreennccee
                   Follow symbolic links as if they were normal files or di-
                   rectories.

     --jj,, ----bbzziipp22,, ----bbuunnzziipp22
                   Use bzip2(1) for compression of the archive.  This option
                   is a GNU extension.

     --kk, ----kkeeeepp--oolldd--ffiilleess
                   Keep existing files; don't overwrite them from archive.

     --ll, ----oonnee--ffiillee--ssyysstteemm
                   Do not cross filesystems.

     --mm, ----mmooddiiffiiccaattiioonn--ttiimmee
                   Do not preserve modification time.

     --OO            Write old-style (non-POSIX) archives.

     --oo, ----ppoorrttaabbiilliittyy, ----oolldd--aarrcchhiivvee
                   Don't write directory information that the older (V7) style
                   ttaarr is unable to decode.  This implies the --OO flag.

     --pp, ----pprreesseerrvvee--ppeerrmmiissssiioonnss, ----pprreesseerrvvee
                   Preserve user and group ID as well as file mode regardless
                   of the current umask(2).  The setuid and setgid bits are
                   only preserved if the user is the superuser.  Only meaning-
                   ful in conjunction with the --xx flag.

     --qq, ----ffaasstt--rreeaadd
                   Select the first archive member that matches each _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
                   operand.  No more than one archive member is matched for
                   each _p_a_t_t_e_r_n.  When members of type directory are matched,
                   the file hierarchy rooted at that directory is also
                   matched.

     --ss _r_e_p_l_s_t_r    Modify the file or archive member names specified by the
                   _p_a_t_t_e_r_n or _f_i_l_e operands according to the substitution ex-
                   pression _r_e_p_l_s_t_r, using the syntax of the ed(1) utility
                   regular expressions.  The format of these regular expres-
                   sions are:
                         /old/new/[gp]
                   As in ed(1), oolldd is a basic regular expression and nneeww can
                   contain an ampersand (), \n (where n is a digit) back-ref-
                   erences, or subexpression matching.  The oolldd string may al-
                   so contain <newline> characters.  Any non-null character
                   can be used as a delimiter (/ is shown here).  Multiple --ss
                   expressions can be specified.  The expressions are applied
                   in the order they are specified on the command line, termi-
                   nating with the first successful substitution.  The option-
                   al trailing gg continues to apply the substitution expres-
                   sion to the pathname substring which starts with the first
                   character following the end of the last successful substi-
                   tution.  The first unsuccessful substitution stops the op-
                   eration of the gg option.  The optional trailing pp will
                   cause the final result of a successful substitution to be
                   written to standard error in the following format:
                         <original pathname> >> <new pathname>
                   File or archive member names that substitute to the empty
                   string are not selected and will be skipped.

     --vv            Verbose operation mode.

     --ww, ----iinntteerraaccttiivvee, ----ccoonnffiirrmmaattiioonn
                   Interactively rename files.  This option causes ttaarr to
                   prompt the user for the filename to use when storing or ex-
                   tracting files in an archive.

     --zz, ----ggzziipp, ----gguunnzziipp
                   Compress archive using gzip.

     --BB, ----rreeaadd--ffuullll--bblloocckkss
                   Reassemble small reads into full blocks (For reading from
                   4.2BSD pipes).

     --CC _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y, ----ddiirreeccttoorryy _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
                   This is a positional argument which sets the working direc-
                   tory for the following files.  When extracting, files will
                   be extracted into the specified directory; when creating,
                   the specified files will be matched from the directory.
                   This argument and its parameter may also appear in a file
                   list specified by --TT.

     --HH            Follow symlinks given on command line only.

     --PP, ----aabbssoolluuttee--ppaatthhss
                   Do not strip leading slashes (`/') from pathnames.  The de-
                   fault is to strip leading slashes.

     --TT _f_i_l_e, ----ffiilleess--ffrroomm _f_i_l_e
                   Read the names of files to archive or extract from the giv-
                   en file, one per line.  A line may also specify the posi-
                   tional argument ``--CC _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y''.

     --XX _f_i_l_e, ----eexxcclluuddee--ffrroomm _f_i_l_e
                   Exclude files listed in the given file.

     --ZZ, ----ccoommpprreessss, ----uunnccoommpprreessss
                   Compress archive using compress.

     ----ssttrriicctt      Do not enable GNU tar extensions such as long filenames and
                   long link names.

     ----aattiimmee--pprreesseerrvvee
                   Preserve file access times.

     ----uunnlliinnkk      Remove files before creating them.

     ----uussee--ccoommpprreessss--pprrooggrraamm _p_r_o_g_r_a_m
                   Use the named program as the program to decompress the in-
                   put.

     ----ffoorrccee--llooccaall
                   Do not interpret filenames that contain a `:' as remote
                   files.

     ----iinnsseeccuurree    Normally ttaarr ignores filenames that contain `..' as a path
                   component.  With this option, files that contain `..' can
                   be processed.

     The options [--001144557788] can be used to select one of the compiled-in backup
     devices, _/_d_e_v_/_r_s_t_N.

     ttaarr will exit with one of the following values:

     0   All files were processed successfully.

     1   An error occurred.

     Whenever ttaarr cannot create a file or a link when extracting an archive or
     cannot find a file while writing an archive, or cannot preserve the user
     ID, group ID, file mode, or access and modification times when the --pp op-
     tion is specified, a diagnostic message is written to standard error and
     a non-zero exit value will be returned, but processing will continue.  In
     the case where ttaarr cannot create a link to a file, ttaarr will not create a
     second copy of the file.

     If the extraction of a file from an archive is prematurely terminated by
     a signal or error, ttaarr may have only partially extracted the file the us-
     er wanted.  Additionally, the file modes of extracted files and directo-
     ries may have incorrect file bits, and the modification and access times
     may be wrong.

     If the creation of an archive is prematurely terminated by a signal or
     error, ttaarr may have only partially created the archive which may violate
     the specific archive format specification.
