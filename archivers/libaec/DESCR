Libaec provides fast lossless compression of 1 up to 32 bit wide signed
or unsigned integers (samples). The library achieves best results for
low entropy data as often encountered in space imaging instrument data or
numerical model output from weather or climate simulations. While floating
point representations are not directly supported, they can also be efficiently
coded by grouping exponents and mantissa.

Libaec implements Golomb-Rice coding as defined in the Space Data System
Standard documents 121.0-B-2 and 120.0-G-2.

Libaec includes a free drop-in replacement for the SZIP library.
