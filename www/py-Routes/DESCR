Routes is a Python re-implementation of the Rails routes system for
mapping URLs to Controllers/Actions and generating URLs. Routes makes
it easy to create pretty and concise URLs that are RESTful with little
effort.

Speedy and dynamic URL generation means you get a URL with minimal
cruft (no big dangling query args). Shortcut features like Named
Routes cut down on repetitive typing.
