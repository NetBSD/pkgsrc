Sigal is yet another simple static gallery generator. It's written
in Python and it allows to build a static gallery of images with
the following features:

* Process directories recursively.
* Generate HTML pages using Jinja2 templates.
* Relative links for a portable output.
* Support themes, videos, EXIF tags, zip download.
* Parallel processing.
* MIT licensed.

The idea behind Sigal is to ease the use of the javascript libraries
like galleria. These libraries do a great job to display the images,
Sigal does what is missing: resize images, create thumbnails,
generate HTML pages.
