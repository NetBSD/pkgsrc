The default Apache::Gallery templates have been installed in

    ${AG_SHAREDIR}/templates

The templates refer to icons and stylesheets, that need to be accessible
through your HTTP server.  If you are running Apache, then you may either
symlink
	
	ln -s ${AG_SHAREDIR}/htdocs ${AG}

in DocumentRoot, or add the following line to httpd.conf:

	Include ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/${AG}.conf

For more configuration information, see the following files:

	${AG_DOCDIR}/INSTALL
	${AG_DOCDIR}/README
	${AG_DOCDIR}/UPGRADE
