Working with objects that know how to render themselves as HTML elements is a
common pattern found in complex Django applications (e.g. the Wagtail admin
interface). This package provides tools enable and support working with such
objects, also known as "components".

The APIs provided in the package have previously been discovered, developed and
solidified in the Wagtail project. The purpose of this package is to make these
tools available to other Django projects outside the Wagtail ecosystem.
