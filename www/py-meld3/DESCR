meld3 is an HTML/XML templating system for Python which keeps
template markup and dynamic rendering logic separate from one
another. See http://www.entrian.com/PyMeld for a treatise on the
benefits of this pattern.

meld3 can deal with HTML or XML/XHTML input and can output well-formed
HTML or XML/XHTML.

meld3 is a variation of Paul Winkler's Meld2, which is itself a
variation of Richie Hindle's PyMeld.

meld3 uses Frederik Lundh's ElementTree library.
