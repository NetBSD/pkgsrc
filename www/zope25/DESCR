Zope is a free, open source web application platform used for building
high-performance, dynamic web sites.

The Zope architecture competes in the web application server market
against products such as Cold Fusion, Silverstream, Netscape Application
Server, and the like.  These products are aimed at systems programmers
and relational databases.  Zope, however, contains a powerful and simple
scripting object model and high-performance, integrated object database. 
Thus the term "platform".
