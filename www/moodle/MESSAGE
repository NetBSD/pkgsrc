Add the following line to httpd.conf to make Moodle accessible
through your HTTP server:

	Include ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/moodle.conf

Your Moodle is then accessible through:

	http://www.example.com/moodle/

Then create a user and a database for Moodle to store all
its tables in (or choose an existing database).

For more information, see the INSTALL DOCUMENTATION:

	https://docs.moodle.org/en/Installing_Moodle

# NOTE: `max_input_vars' requirement

Starting with PHP 8.0, Moodle requires a minimal value of 5000 for the
`max_input_vars' environment variable. This can be directly set within
the php.ini file, usually found under:

	${PKG_SYSCONFBASE}/php.ini

Or overriden through the Apache configuration file; see example in:

	${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/moodle.conf

More details are available via the Moodle documentation:

	https://docs.moodle.org/403/en/Environment_-_max_input_vars
