litehtml is a lightweight HTML rendering engine with CSS2/CSS3
support. litehtml does not depend on any image/drawing/font
library as it does not draw any text, pictures or other
graphics itself. The consumer of the library can use any
library to draw images, fonts and any other graphics. HTML
elements are just placed into the right position by litehtml.
