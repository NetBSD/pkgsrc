Mozilla is an open-source web browser, designed for standards compliance,
performance and portability.

It provides users with acclaimed browsing convenience along with power
features such as pop-up blocking and tabbed browsing. Mozilla also provides
a sophisticated platform for developing web applications using technologies
such as XML, SOAP and XSLT.

mozilla-gtk2 uses GTK2 widget set.

Please note that the Mozilla Suite has been end-of-lifed in favour of the
stand-alone components www/firefox (for browsing) and mail/thunderbird (for
e-mail).  Alternatively there is www/seamonkey, a community-driven project
to continue the Mozilla Suite.
