This is a module to handle the inflation and deflation of complex HTTP
header types. In many cases header values are simple strings, but in some
cases they are complex values with a lot of information encoded in them.
The goal of this module is to make the parsing and analysis of these headers
as easy as calling inflate on a compatible object.

This top-level class is basically a Factory for creating instances of the
other classes in this module. It contains a number of convenience methods to
help make common cases easy to write.
