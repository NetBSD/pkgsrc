The latest beta version of the most popular web server on the 'net.
This version is quite stable, and includes proxy server support, as
well as the ability to add modules that add many other features.

You'll have to edit the configuration files in /usr/pkg/http/conf
before you start it. The default root directory for documents is
/usr/pkg/http/htdocs. Start it with `httpd -d /usr/pkg/http' in
your /etc/rc.local file.
