The library is a set of useful tools for aiohttp.web server.

The full list of tools is:

 * AllowedHosts – restrict a set of incoming connections to allowed hosts only.
 * BasicAuth – protect web application by basic auth authorization.
 * Cloudflare – make sure that web application is protected by CloudFlare.
 * ForwardedRelaxed and ForwardedStrict – process Forwarded HTTP header and
   modify corresponding scheme, host, remote attributes in strong secured and
   relaxed modes.
 * Secure – ensure that web application is handled by HTTPS (SSL/TLS) only,
   redirect plain HTTP to HTTPS automatically.
 * XForwardedRelaxed and XForwardedStrict – the same as ForwardedRelaxed and
   ForwardedStrict but process old-fashion X-Forwarded-* headers instead of new
   standard Forwarded.
