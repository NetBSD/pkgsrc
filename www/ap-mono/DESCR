Mod_Mono is an Apache 1.3/2.0/2.2 module that provides ASP.NET support for the
web's favorite server, Apache.
The module passes off requests for ASP.NET pages to an external program,
mod-mono-server, which actually handles the requests. The communication between
the Apache module and mod-mono-server is established using a Unix socket or a
TCP socket.
