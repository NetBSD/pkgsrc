Please refer to the file:

	${PREFIX}/share/doc/horde/INSTALL

to setup Horde to access its database properly.  The short summary is to
edit:

	${HORDEDIR}/config/horde.php

to specify the correct backend database, and run the appropriate scripts
in:

	${HORDEDIR}/scripts/db

to setup the horde database.  You will also need to install the appropriate
php module, such as databases/php4-mysql or databases/php4-pgsql.  Horde is
setup by default to access MySQL.  It's recommended that you change the
password of the 'hordemgr' user used to connect to the horde database.  For
localhost security, the file

	${HORDEDIR}/config/horde.php

should be accessible only to the webserver process as it contains the
horde database password.

You will also need to make Horde accessible through your HTTP server.  If
you are running Apache and ap-php, then you can add the following line
to httpd.conf:

	Include ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/horde.conf

to make Horde accessible through:

	http://www.domain.com/horde/
