	Embperl gives you the power to embed Perl code in your HTML
	documents.  Using Perl means being able to use a very
	elaborate programming language, which is widely used for
	WWW purposes. You can also use hundreds of Perl modules
	which have already been written - including DBI - for
	database access to a growing number of database systems.

	While this could also be done with other packages, Embperl
	has several features especially for HTML: dynamic tables,
	formfield-processing, escaping/unescaping and more.

	Embperl is a server-side tool, which means it's
	browser-indpendent.  It can run in various ways: Under
	mod_perl, as a cgi script, or offline.

	There is also a module for Database access within Embperl,
	look at DBIx::Recordset.
