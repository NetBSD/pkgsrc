# xmlada is built-in (not optional) due to gprbuild dependency
# zlib is built-in because it's mandatory.  It even comes with AWS.
# ASIS is not supported right now (custom build, requires part of GNAT)

# The "ipv6" option effectively disabled IPv4 support, so it
# should not be switched on per default even on systems which
# support IPv6. For that reason, the option name is not "inet6".

# The system libgcc is from version 4.1 which doesn't include the symbol
# _Unwind_GetIPInfo.  If AWS uses the system zlib or if it's configured to use
# SSL the search path /usr/lib is inserted in the gnatmake/gprbuild
# instructions and the system libgcc.a is picked up instead of
# /usr/pkg/lib/libgcc.a.  This is a bug confirmed by Adacore and an internal
# bug report has been generated.  In the meantime, this means AWS can't be
# configured for HTTPS on NetBSD, and that zlib must be built from scratch on
# NetBSD until NetBSD upgrades it's libgcc or until a new GNAT and GPRBuild
# are delivered that don't have this bug.
