The intention of this application is to enable static app files (css, js, pics)
in the app folder itself.
	<application1>/media/<application1>/js/script.js
	<application2>/media/<application2>/js/script.js
	<project>/media/logo.jpg

To use this view in development you should add something like the following to
urls.py:
	if settings.DEBUG:
	  urlpatterns += (r'^media/(?P<path>.*)$', 'site.media.serve_apps',
	  {'document_root' : settings.MEDIA_ROOT})

For deployment there is a managament command called `symlinkmedia` that will
create symlinks to each applications media directory in `MEDIA_ROOT`.

Now all apps in INSTALLED_APPS that have a "media" directory in them will be
reachable as '/media/<application_name>/'.

You can then have the admin media files served by setting
	ADMIN_MEDIA_PREFIX = '/media/admin/'
