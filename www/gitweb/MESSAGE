The gitweb configuration file is located at:

	${CONFFILE}

At the very least you should set the `projectroot' variable in it to point
to where your git repositories are.

After that, you might be able to access the interface at the URL shown
below, assuming that you are using the default location for Apache's
htdocs:

	http://localhost/cgi-bin/cgiweb.cgi

(See the pkgsrc Makefile for apache config paths vs gitweb
installation; this package does not depend on apache.)
