The SeaMonkey project is a community effort to deliver production-quality
releases of code derived from the application formerly known as "Mozilla
Application Suite". Whereas the main focus of the Mozilla Foundation is on
Mozilla Firefox and Mozilla Thunderbird, our group of dedicated volunteers
works to ensure that you can have "everything but the kitchen sink" (a web
browser, mail client, HTML composer, address book, IRC client and calendar),
and have it stable enough for corporate use.

This package is a preview of the upcoming stable version, showing off new but
potentially not finalized features. It is intended for developers and testers
only -- not for end users.  To get the latest version intended for end users,
use the www/seamonkey* packages.
