WhiteNoise provides radically simplified static file serving for Python
web apps.

With a couple of lines of config WhiteNoise allows your web app to serve
its own static files, making it a self-contained unit that can be
deployed anywhere without relying on nginx, Amazon S3 or any other
external service. (Especially useful on Heroku, OpenShift and other PaaS
providers.)

It's designed to work nicely with a CDN for high-traffic sites so you
don't have to sacrifice performance to benefit from simplicity.

WhiteNoise works with any WSGI-compatible app but has some special
auto-configuration features for Django.

WhiteNoise takes care of best-practices for you, for instance:

- Serving compressed content (gzip and Brotli formats, handling
Accept-Encoding and Vary headers correctly)

- Setting far-future cache headers on content which won't change
