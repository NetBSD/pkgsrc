This is the README to cgi.tcl, a library of Tcl procedures to assist
in writing CGI scripts.  Review the HISTORY file for significant changes.

The cgi.tcl home page is http://expect.nist.gov/cgi.tcl

--------------------
Introduction
--------------------

This is the README file for cgi.tcl, a set of procedures for writing
CGI scripts in Tcl.  The procedures implement the code described in
the paper "Writing CGI scripts in Tcl" which was published in the
Proceedings of the Fourth Tcl Workshop (Tcl '96).

--------------------
Getting Started
--------------------

First, read the paper "Writing CGI Scripts in Tcl", from Tcl '96.  If
you can't find the paper in this archive, it can also be found at:

	http://www.nist.gov/msidlibrary/doc/libes96c.ps

That paper will give you a lot of good ideas for using Tcl, not only
with CGI but plain everyday HTML as well.

Next, try some of the examples in the example directory.  Please read
the "Instructions" section in example/README first.

A rough draft of complete documentation of the individual functions
can be found in ref.txt in the doc directory.  

Note that you are expected to understand Tcl.  I'm not going to
explain how to write Tcl scripts here.  (If you're looking for a Tcl
tutorial, please consider my Expect book which includes a very nice
tutorial on Tcl.)

Similarly, you are expected to understand HTML.  There are plenty of
web tutorials and books on it.  Go read one.  You don't have to become
an expert on HTML, but it is important to get a feel for it.  (The
cgi.tcl package will take care of the details.)  If you plan to do
CGI, you should know a couple more basic things.  Here's a simple CGI
intro:

--------------------
Status
--------------------

The library is reasonably complete.  It supports forms, tables,
cookies, Netscape extensions, file upload, plug-ins, etc, etc.  On the
other hand, there are some things missing - such as certain deprecated
things in HTML, things I can't believe anyone would use, things that
are special extensions to a browser I'm not familiar with, etc.

This library should run on any system (UNIX, Win, or Mac) which
supports Tcl 8.0.

----------------------
Examples
----------------------

This distribution contains example scripts.  They can be found in the
example directory of this distribution.  Please read the
"Instructions" section in example/README first.

--------------------
Installation
--------------------

If you are on UNIX, read the INSTALL file.
If you are on W95/NT, read the install.win file.
If you are on Mac, read the install.mac file.

--------------------
How to get the latest version of this code
--------------------

The latest version of this code may be received from:

	http://expect.nist.gov/cgi.tcl/cgi.tcl.tar.gz
or	ftp://ftp.nist.gov/mel/div826/subject/expect/cgi.tcl/cgi.tcl.tar.gz

Request email delivery by mailing to "library@cme.nist.gov".  The
contents of the message should be (no subject line) "send
pub/cgi/cgi.tcl.tar.gz".

--------------------
Support from Don Libes or NIST
--------------------

Although I can't promise anything in the way of support, I'd be
interested to hear about your experiences using it (good or bad).  I'm
also interested in hearing bug reports and suggestions for improvement
even though I can't promise to implement them.

If you send me a bug, fix, or question, include the version of
cgi.tcl, version of Tcl, and name and version of the OS that you are
using.  Before sending mail, it may be helpful to verify that your
problem still exists in the latest version.  You can check on the
current release and whether it addresses your problems by retrieving
the latest HISTORY file (see "History" above).


Awards, love letters, and bug reports may be sent to:

I hereby place this software in the public domain.  NIST and I would
appreciate credit if this program or parts of it are used.

Design and implementation of this program was funded primarily by
myself.  Funding contributors include the NIST Automated Manufacturing
Research Facility (funded by the Navy Manufacturing Technology
Program), the NIST Scientific and Technical Research Services, the
ARPA Persistent Object Bases project and the Computer-aided
Acquisition and the Logistic Support (CALS) program of the Office of
the Secretary of Defense.

Support for Don Libes or NIST
--------------------

NIST accepts external funding and other resources (hardware, software,
and personnel).  This can be a fine way to work more closely with NIST
and encourage particular areas of research.

Funding can be earmarked for specific purposes or for less-specific
purposes.  For example, if you simply like the work I do, you can
contribute directly to my funding which will reduce the amount of time
I have to spend writing proposals and submitting them to other people
for funding on my own.

I can also participate in the NIST Fellows program allowing me to
spend several months to a year working directly with your company and
potentially even at your location.  I am also interested in returning
to an academic program.  I presently have an MS and am hunting for
Ph.D. topics and advisors.  Let me know if you have ideas or are
interested in being my advisor.
