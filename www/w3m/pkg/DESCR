W3m is a termial-based WWW browser which supports HTML tables and frames.
It's small, so faster than other WWW browsers.  It also supports following
URL by clicking mouse button on the anchor in xterm and its variants from
990526 version.

It uses Boehm-GC to implement the table/frame parser.

Introduction

  I have tried the muntilingualization of w3m (w3m-m17n).
  The patch for w3m-0.2.1 is available on the following site.

                                                README.m17n

  It is a development version. And enough test is not preformed because
  I can understand Japanese only. Please use, test, and report bugs.
