  Adzap has now been installed.  To get it up and running, copy
  @@PREFIX@@/share/examples/adzap/adzap.conf to /etc and modify
  it to match your setup.  Then edit your squid configuration and
  add @@PREFIX@@/libexec/adzap as your http-redirector.

  If you run a web server, you can copy the *.{html,js,gif} file from
  @@PREFIX@@/share/examples/adzap to your htdocs tree and modify
  the web locations in /etc/adzap.conf accordingly.
