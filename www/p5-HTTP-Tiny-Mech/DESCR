This code is somewhat poorly documented, and highly experimental.

Its the result of a quick bit of hacking to get MetaCPAN::API working
faster via the WWW::Mechanize::Cached module ( and gaining cache
persistence via CHI )

It works so far for this purpose.

At present, only "get" and "request" are implemented, and all other
calls fall through to a native HTTP::Tiny.
