A module for generating nice looking HTML files from HTML trees. 
It is especially usefull if the produced HTML file shall be read 
or edited manually afterwards. Various parameters let you adapt 
the output to different styles and requirements.
 
If you don't care how the HTML source looks like as long as it is 
valid and readable by browsers, you should use the as_HTML() method 
of HTML::Element instead of the pretty printer.
