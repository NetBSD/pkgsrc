To complete the setup you will need to read the INSTALL.txt in order
to setup MySQL/PostgreSQL properly.

You will need to make Drupal accessible through your HTTP server. If you
are running Apache then you may add the following lines to httpd.conf:

	Include ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/drupal.conf

to make Drupal accessible through:

	http://localhost/drupal/
