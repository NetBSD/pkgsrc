SpeedyCGI is a way to run perl scripts persistently, which can make them run 
much more quickly. A script can be made to to run persistently by changing 
the interpreter line at the top of the script from: 

    #!${LOCALBASE}/bin/perl

to 

    #!${LOCALBASE}/bin/speedy

After the script is initially run, instead of exiting, the perl interpreter 
is kept running. During subsequent runs, this interpreter is used to handle 
new executions instead of starting a new perl interpreter each time. A very 
fast frontend program, written in C, is executed for each request. This fast 
frontend then contacts the persistent Perl process, which is usually already 
running, to do the work and return the results.
