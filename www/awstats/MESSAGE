An example file has been installed as
${PREFIX}/share/examples/awstats/awstats.conf.  After adjusting it to
your needs, copy it to ${PREFIX}/awstats/cgi-bin/awstats.conf.

Alternatively, you can also now use ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR} to store your awstats
configuration files.

You may need to adjust the cgi-bin path of your webserver -- for details,
refer to the documentation in
	${PREFIX}/share/doc/html/awstats
