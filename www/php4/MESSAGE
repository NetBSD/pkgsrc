To process PHP scripts, you will need a PHP-enabled HTTP server.  You may
either configure the HTTP server to use PHP as a CGI program, or install a
PHP module for your HTTP server, e.g. ap-php.

Some additional packages you may wish to install are:

	php-dba		DBM database access
	php-iconv	character set conversion

Note that php4-pcre, php4-session and php4-xml are no longer
separate packages since 4.3.3, the main PHP4 package has them built-in now.

Note php-openssl has been removed as separate package as of 4.4.0nb2, the
main PHP4 package has it built-in now.
