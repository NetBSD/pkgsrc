Minify is a minifier package written in Go. It provides HTML5,
CSS3, JS, JSON, SVG, and XML minifiers.

Minification is the process of removing bytes from a file (such as
whitespace) without changing its output and therefore shrinking its
size and speeding up transmission over the internet and possibly
parsing. The implemented minifiers are designed for high performance.

This package includes the command line tool that minifies concurrently
and watches file changes.
