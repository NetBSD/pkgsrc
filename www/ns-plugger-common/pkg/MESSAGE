==========================================================================
  Plugger has now been installed on your system.

  This package is only a plugin wrapper around common multimedia
  utilities.  If you want to use plugger to display a certain file type
  at least one of the utilities listed for that particular file type has
  to be present:

	file type	utilities
	---------	---------
	MPEG video	mtv, xanim
	Quicktime	xanim
	midi		midiplay, timidity
	mod		mikmod, nspmod
	MPEG Layer 3	splay, amp, mpg123, maplay, gqmpeg
	PNG, TIFF	ImageMagick, xv

  The plugger package does not automatically depend on these utilities,
  but all of them are available as packages. You will find them in the
  package categories audio and graphics.

  For information on adding more file types and applications, type
  `man plugger'.  To use a different (or no) plugin for a specific file
  type, use the Navigator/Applications preferences of your Netscape
  browser.
