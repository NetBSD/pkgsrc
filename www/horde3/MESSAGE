Please refer to the file:

	${PREFIX}/share/doc/horde/INSTALL

to setup Horde to access its user preferences store properly.  The short 
summary is to run the appropriate scripts in:

	${HORDEDIR}/scripts/db

to setup the horde preferences store.  Horde is setup by default to access 
MySQL.  It's recommended that you change the password of the 'horde' user used 
to connect to the horde database.  

You will also need to make Horde accessible through your HTTP server.  If
you are running Apache and ap-php, then you can add the following line
to httpd.conf:

	Include ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/horde.conf

to make Horde accessible through:
	
	http://www.domain.com/horde/
