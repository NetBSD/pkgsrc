IceWM provides a small, fast and familiar window manager for the X11 window
system.  Compatibility with the mwm window manager is desired and will be
implemented where appropriate.

IceWM is designed to emulate the look of Motif, OS/2 Warp 4, OS/2 Warp 3 and
Windows 95.  It also tries to combine the feel of these systems whenever it
is compatible.  Others might added in the future in the core distribution,
though many themes are available through the network.

Generally, it tries to make all functions available both by keyboard and by
mouse (this is not currently possible when using mouse focus).

This package provides IceWM 1.4 branch release.
