awesome is a tiling window manager initialy based on a dwm code
rewriting.  It's extremely fast, small, dynamic and awesome.

Windows can be managed in several layouts: tiled, maximized, dwindle,
spiral, floating. Each layout can be applied on the fly, optimizing
the environment for the application in use and the task performed.

Managing windows in tiled mode assures that no space will be wasted
on your screen. No gaps, no overlap. Other layouts can be used for
different purpose.

If you do not want to use the tiling management, you can use the
floating layout wich will let you organize your windows as you
wish, like any other window manager.
