Shod is an hybrid (tiling and floating) multimonitor X11 window manager.
Shod sets no keybindings; reads no configuration other than X resources;
and works only via mouse with a given key modifier (Alt by default), and
by responding to client messages with EWMH hints (so you must use wmctrl
to control shod).

NOTE: shod provides no keybindings, use sxhkd for binding keys.

WARNING: Shod is attempt of mine to write a Wm and better understand how
         X11 works, Shod is only meant for me for educational purposes.
         Shod is an experimental project, and should be used with caution.
