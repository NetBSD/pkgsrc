The aewm++ window manager is a fork of the popular minimal 
window manager aewm for the X Windows System. What makes 
it different is its codebase, feature set and focus. The 
name was created by using the first two letters in the word 
aesthetic, the wm is for window manager and the ++ is for 
its C++ code.
