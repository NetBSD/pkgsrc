The session manager may be run from XDM by setting the
DisplayManager*session X resource in xdm-config to xmsession, or by execing
xmsm from ~/.Xprofile.  Just make sure to test whether it works by running
'xinit xmsession' before doing any of the above. Note that 'xmsession' is
just a shell script that sets up the environment for xmsm, and is not
needed when this has been done already.
-
xmsm is installed suid root, this is required for screen locking and
running sbin commands. Privileges are dropped at startup and are reacquired
only when necessary.
-
System shutdown, reboot and suspend commands can be altered at compile time
only. Edit constants in smconf.h, or override them in CFLAGS if necessary.
