This package provides the XmSm and XmToolbox utilities, to use in
conjuction with the Enhanced Motif Window Manager.

- XmSm is simple session manager that provides session configuration and
  screen locking, as well as shutdown/suspend options. It also launches the
  window manager and the toolbox.

- XmToolbox is a toolchest-like application launcher, which reads its
  multi-level menu structure from a simple plain-text file (namely
  ~/.toolboxrc).  It also communicates with the session manager to provide
  lock, log out, and shutdown commands.
