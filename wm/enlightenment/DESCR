Enlightenment 16 is a window manager for the X Window System that is designed
to be powerful, extensible, configurable and pretty darned good looking!  It is
one of the more graphically intense window managers.

Enlightenment goes beyond managing windows by providing a useful and appealing
graphical shell from which to work.  It is open in design and instead of
dictating a policy, allows the user to define their own policy, down to every
last detail.

This is Enlightenment 16, an older, stable branch which continues to be
maintained separately from ongoing Enlightenment development, due to its more
lightweight nature.
