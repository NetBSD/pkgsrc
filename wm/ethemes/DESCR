Themes for the E16 branch of the window manager Enlightenment.

What exactly are themes?
----------------------------------
Themes are a great aspect of Enlightenment allowing a user to simply save the
entire 'look' of their desktop in a Archive to distribute freely among
friends,  fellow users and/or the whole net in general. :)

NB these themes only work with E16. E17 and newer use a different,
incompatible format.
