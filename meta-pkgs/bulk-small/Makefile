MAINTAINER=	dholland@NetBSD.org
COMMENT=	Meta-package for a standard short limited bulk build

META_PACKAGE=	yes

RESTRICTED=		Just for test build purpose
NO_BIN_ON_CDROM=	${RESTRICTED}
NO_BIN_ON_FTP=		${RESTRICTED}

#
# Note: The purpose of this package is to produce a small set of the
# most generally useful packages in a short time. On a fast build
# machine this whole meta-package should build in less than an
# hour. This gives it a fighting chance of being useful on slow
# platforms.
#
# Please don't arbitrarily add your favorite software in here, or
# on the other hand remove packages just because you don't consider
# them useful in your circumstances.
#
# Candidates for addition (or removal) should be discussed on
# tech-pkg. Undiscussed alterations will be reverted.
#
# If you aren't sure about why some particular package is or is not
# included, please ask.
#

#
# XXX: A few of these packages are commonly built in. The simple
# BUILD_DEPENDS logic here will cause more or less useless packages to be
# built anyway and then not used, which is a waste of build cycles. It
# would be good to figure out a way to fix this so these packages only
# get built when they aren't builtin.
#
# That applies to these packages:
#    wget  bzip2  xz
#    libiconv  sqlite3  gettext-lib  readline  zlib  expat
#

#
# 1. Applications. These should be either very small or very widely used,
# or preferably both; all others should go in bulk-medium.
#
# Please do not "fix" the emacs reference by updating it to emacs23 or
# newer, as those versions of emacs take longer to build than this
# entire package's time budget.

# Note that X11 depends aren't included here. This package was laid
# out for native X11; it will of course work for pkgsrc X11 also but
# take somewhat longer.
