Meta-package that includes all packages needed for the NetBSD
Documentation project to convert SGML/DocBook to PDF/PS.

Excluded from netbsd-doc into a seperate package because it wants
teTeX, which is rather large in size. 

Nevertheless you'll need external PostScript and PDF previewers,
e.g. Acrobat Reader, xpdf, gv, etc.
