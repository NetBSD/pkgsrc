KDE provides an integrated X11 based environment, much like CDE.

This package does not contain anything by itself -- it is a
"meta-package" that depends on other KDE packages.  Its sole purpose is
to require dependencies so users can install this package only and
have all the KDE stuff pulled in by the package dependency mechanism.
