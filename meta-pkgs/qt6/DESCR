Qt(TM) is a GUI software toolkit. Qt simplifies the task of writing and
maintaining GUI (graphical user interface) applications.

This package does not contain anything by itself -- it is a
"meta-package" that depends on other QT packages.  Its sole purpose is
to require dependencies so users can install this package only and
have all the QT stuff pulled in by the port/package dependency
mechanism.

This package tracks Qt6 branch.
