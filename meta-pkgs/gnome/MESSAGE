In order to get the GNOME Desktop running properly, you need to follow
these manual steps:

1) Enable the File Alteration Monitor.  See 'pkg_info -D fam' for more
   information.  If you chose to use gamin instead of fam, you do not need
   to take this step.

2) Enable the system dbus daemon.  In order to do that, copy the
   ${PREFIX}/share/examples/rc.d/dbus script to /etc/rc.d and add
   dbus=YES to your /etc/rc.conf file.

3) Enable the hal daemon if GNOME has been built with the hal option (the
   default).  In order to do that, copy the ${PREFIX}/share/examples/rc.d/hal
   script to /etc/rc.d and set hal=YES in your /etc/rc.conf file.

4) Enable the cups daemon if you installed it.  In order to do that, copy
   the ${PREFIX}/share/examples/rc.d/{cupsd,slpd} scripts to /etc/rc.d and
   set cupsd=YES and slpd=NO in your /etc/rc.conf file.

5) Set up the gnome-screensaver PAM service by creating the
   /etc/pam.d/gnome-screensaver file.  You can use one of the files
   in ${PREFIX}/share/examples/gnome-screensaver/pam.d as templates.

6) Optionally enable the Avahi DNS Service Discovery service if you
   installed it.  In order to do that, copy the
   ${PREFIX}/share/examples/rc.d/avahidaemon script to /etc/rc.d and set
   avahidaemon=YES in your /etc/rc.conf file.

7) Optionally enable GDM (highly recommended).  Just copy the
   ${PREFIX}/share/examples/rc.d/gdm script to /etc/rc.d and add
   gdm=YES to your /etc/rc.conf file.
