Emacspeak is a speech interface that allows visually impaired users
to interact independently and efficiently with the computer. Audio
formatting --a technique pioneered by AsTeR-- and full support for
W3C's Aural CSS (ACSS) allows Emacspeak to produce rich aural
presentations of electronic information. By seamlessly blending
all aspects of the Internet such as Web-surfing and messaging,
Emacspeak speech-enables local and remote information via a consistent
and well-integrated user interface. Available free of cost on the
Internet, Emacspeak has dramatically changed how the author and
thousands of blind and visually impaired users around the world
interact with the personal computer and the Internet. A rich suite
of task-oriented tools provides efficient speech-enabled access to
the audio desktop and evolving semantic WWW. When combined with
Linux running on low-cost PC hardware, Emacspeak/Linux provides a
reliable, stable speech-friendly solution that opens up the Internet
to visually impaired users around the world.
