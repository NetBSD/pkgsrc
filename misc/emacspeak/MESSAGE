Add (load-library "emacspeak-setup.el") at the beginning of your
.emacs to activate Emacspeak in every Emacs execution, or use the -l
option when executing Emacs.

If you can't hear the auditory icons and other sound effects, set the
Emacs variable emacspeak-play-program and the environment variable
EMACSPEAK_PLAY to the path of your audio player of choice.
