KanjiPad is a very simple program for handwriting recognition -
The user draws a character into the box, then requests translation.
The best candidates are displayed along the right hand side of
the window and can be selected for pasting into other programs.
 
It is meant primarily for dictionary purposes for learners of Japanese
- it does not support entering kana, so it's usefulness as an input
method is limited. Furthermore, if you already know the reading of a
character, conventional pronunciation based methods of entering the
character are probably faster.
