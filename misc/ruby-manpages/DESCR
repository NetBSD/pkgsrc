Manpages

This plugin will add man pages support to ruby gems.  Instead of adding a
new command like gem-man it will try to link the files to a place the man
command automatically discovers.

With rvm and chruby it works out of the box, but sadly for rbenv we need to
add hooks that modify the man symlink depending on the ruby version
currently used.
