Displays a given file anywhere on your X11 root window with a
transparent background. It was made because I'm very lazy and this was
easier than making a new rxvt pixmap each time I changed my background
to simulate that transparent effect. A null desc (example:
"/var/log/messages,red,") will prevent the printing of a description
and the []'s.
