Xfinance allows you to set up multiple accounts and categories of 
transactions.  It is ideal for keeping watch over checking, savings and 
401k type accounts.  It's also good for keeping tabs on your credit card 
balances.  It has graphing functions built in that allow it to generate 
graphs with gnuplot.
