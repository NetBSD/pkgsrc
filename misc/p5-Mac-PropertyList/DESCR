This module is a low-level interface to the Mac OS X Property List (plist)
format. You probably shouldn't use this in applications--build interfaces
on top of this so you don't have to put all the heinous multi-level object
stuff where people have to look at it.

You can parse a plist file and get back a data structure. You can take that
data structure and get back the plist as XML. If you want to change the
structure inbetween that's your business. :)

You don't need to be on Mac OS X to use this. It simply parses and
manipulates a text format that Mac OS X uses.
