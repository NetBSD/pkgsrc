mic-paren is an extension and replacement to the packages paren and
stig-paren for Emacs. When mic-paren is active Emacs normal
parenthesis matching is deactivated. Instead parenthesis matching will
be performed as soon as the cursor is positioned at a parenthesis. The
matching parenthesis (or the entire expression between the
parentheses) is highlighted until the cursor is moved away from the
parenthesis.
