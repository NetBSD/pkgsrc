WANDIO is a library for reading from, and writing to, files. Depending on
libraries available at compile time, WANDIO provides transparent
compression/decompression for the following formats:
- zlib (gzip)
- bzip2
- lzo (write-only)
- lzma
- zstd
- lz4
- Intel QAT (write-only)
- http (read-only)

WANDIO also improves IO performance by performing compression/decompression in
a separate thread (if pthreads are available).
