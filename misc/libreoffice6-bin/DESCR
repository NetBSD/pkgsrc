LibreOffice is the free power-packed Open Source personal productivity
suite for Windows, Macintosh and Linux, that gives you six feature-rich
applications for all your document production and data processing
needs: Writer, Calc, Impress, Draw, Math and Base.

This package contains the last release of official Linux binaries of the
libreoffice-6.2 branch. It was left at 6.2 because this is the last
version for which a 32-bit x86 release was provided.
