GXMame is a frontend for XMame using the GTK library, the goal is to provide 
the same GUI than mame32. For the moment it will just have the same gui, the 
final goal is to be able to share config files with Mame32k (or any version 
of mame32 that write config files instead of saving data into windows 
registry) allowing dual booter to have the same environment (favorite, 
timeplayed, last game selected, gui preference...) under windows and unix-like
systems.
