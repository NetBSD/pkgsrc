Parse::Win32Registry is a module for parsing Windows Registry files,
allowing you to read the keys and values of a registry file without
going through the Windows API.

It provides an object-oriented interface to the keys and values in
a registry file. Registry files are structured as trees of keys,
with each key containing further subkeys or values.

The module is intended to be cross-platform, and run on those
platforms where Perl will run.

It supports both Windows NT registry files (Windows NT, 2000, XP, 2003,
Vista, 7) and Windows 95 registry files (Windows 95, 98, Millennium).

It is intended to be used to parse offline registry files. If a registry
file is currently in use, you will not be able to open it. However,
you can save part or all of a currently loaded registry file using the
Windows reg command if you have the appropriate administrative access.
