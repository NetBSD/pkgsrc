The supp-pdf.* files support native MetaPost graphics inclusion in LaTeX
(via pdftex.def) and ConTeXt.  They can be used independently of the
rest of the ConTeXt, yet are maintained as part of it.  So in TeX Live
we pull them out to this separate package for the benefit of LaTeX users
who do not install the rest of ConTeXt.  They can be found on CTAN in
macros/pdftex/graphics.
