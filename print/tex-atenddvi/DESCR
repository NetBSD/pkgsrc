LaTeX offers \AtBeginDvi. This package provides the counterpart
\AtEndDvi. The execution of its argument is delayed to the end
of the document at the end of the last page. At this point
\special and \write remain effective, because they are put into
the last page. This is the main difference from the LaTeX
command \AtEndDocument.
