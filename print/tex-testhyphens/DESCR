The package may be used for testing hyphenation patterns or for
controlling that specific words are hyphenated as expected.
This package implements some old TUGboat code to adapt it to
LaTeX with some enhancements. It differs form \showhyphens,
because it typesets its output on the document's output file.
It also works with xelatex, where \showhyphens requires a
workaround.
