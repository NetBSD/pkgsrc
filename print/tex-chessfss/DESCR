This package offers commands to use and switch between chess fonts.
It uses the LaTeX font selection scheme (nfss). The package doesn't
parse, format and print PGN input like e.g. the packages skak or
texmate; the aim of the package is to offer writers of chess packages
a bundle of commands for fonts, so that they don't have to implement
all these commands for themselves. A normal user can use the package
to print e.g. single chess symbols and simple diagrams. The
documentation contains also a section about installation of chess
fonts.
