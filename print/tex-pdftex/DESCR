An extension of TeX which can be configured to directly generate PDF
documents instead of DVI.  All current free TeX distributions
including TeX live, MacTeX, and MiKTeX include pdfTeX (Plain TeX) and
pdfLaTeX (LaTeX).  ConTeXt was designed around use of pdfTeX (though
it is now migrating towards LuaTeX).
