PGFPlots draws high-quality function plots in normal or
logarithmic scaling with a user-friendly interface directly in
TeX. The user supplies axis labels, legend entries and the plot
coordinates for one or more plots and PGFPlots applies axis
scaling, computes any logarithms and axis ticks and draws the
plots, supporting line plots, scatter plots, piecewise constant
plots, bar plots, area plots, mesh-- and surface plots and some
more. Pgfplots is based on PGF/TikZ (PGF); it runs equally for
LaTeX/TeX/ConTeXt.
