Pgfplots draws high-quality function plots using normal or
logarithmic scaling, with a user-friendly interface. The user
supplies axis labels, legend entries and the plot coordinates
for one or more plots and Pgfplots applies axis scaling,
computes any logarithms and axis ticks and draws the plots.
Pgfplots is based on Till Tantau's package PGF/TikZ.
