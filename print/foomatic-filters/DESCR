The foomatic-filters package provides foomatic-rip and foomatic-gswrapper.

foomatic-rip uses an external renderer (like GhostScript) to
translate PostScript to printer's native language. The printer
capabilities are described in PPD files.  foomatic-rip works with
every known spooler.

foomatic-gswrapper massages arguments to make Ghostscript execute
properly as a filter.
