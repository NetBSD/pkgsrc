Modern native UTF-8 engines such as XeTeX and LuaTeX need
hyphenation patterns in UTF-8 format, whereas older systems
require hyphenation patterns in the 8-bit encoding of the font
in use (such encodings are codified in the LaTeX scheme with
names like OT1, T2A, TS1, OML, LY1, etc). The present package
offers a collection of conversions of existing patterns to UTF-
8 format, together with converters for use with 8-bit fonts in
older systems. Since hyphenation patterns for Knuthian-style
TeX systems are only read at iniTeX time, it is hoped that the
UTF-8 patterns, with their converters, will completely supplant
the older patterns.
