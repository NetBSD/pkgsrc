Gimp-Print is a suite of printer drivers for all UNIX operating systems,
supporting printers from Canon, Epson, Hewlett-Packard, Lexmark, and compatible
printers from other vendors, featuring extremely high quality, flexibility, and
integration with most common printing systems.
Gimp-Print 4.2 includes a core module (libgimpprint) that forms a common print
engine supporting CUPS, Ghostscript, and Foomatic. It also includes the Print
plug-in for the Gimp (version 1.2). The libgimpprint core, which is portable to
all POSIX-compliant operating systems, can also be used by custom printing
solutions.
