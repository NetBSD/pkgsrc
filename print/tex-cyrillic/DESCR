This bundle of macros files provides macro support (including
font encoding macros) for the use of Cyrillic characters in
fonts encoded under the T2* and X2 encodings. These encodings
cover (between them) pretty much every language that is written
in a Cyrillic alphabet. This directory is part of the LaTeX
"required" distribution.
