This package was described in the 2nd edition of 'LaTeX: A
Document Preparation System', but the LaTeX project team
declined to produce the package. For a long time, LaTeX has
included a 'pict2e package' that merely produced an apologetic
error message. The new package extends the existing LaTeX
picture environment, using the familiar technique (cf. the
graphics and color packages) of driver files (at present,
drivers for dvips, pdfTeX, LuaTeX, XeTeX, VTeX, dvipdfm, and
dvipdfmx are available). The package documentation has a fair
number of examples of use, showing where things are improved by
comparison with the LaTeX picture environment.
