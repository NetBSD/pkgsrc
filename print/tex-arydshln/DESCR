The package is to draw dash-lines in array/tabular environments.
Horizontal lines are drawn by \hdashline and \cdashline while vertical
ones can be specified as a part of the preamble using ':'. The shape of
dash-lines may be controlled through style parameters or optional
arguments.

The package is compatible with array, colortab, longtable, and
colortbl.
