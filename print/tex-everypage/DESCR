The "tex-everypage" package provides hooks to perform actions on
every page, or on the current page. Specifically, actions are
performed after the page is composed, but before it is shipped,
so they can be used to prepare the output page in tasks like
putting watermarks in the background, or in setting the next page
layout, etc.
