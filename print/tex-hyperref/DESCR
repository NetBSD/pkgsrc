The hyperref package is used to handle cross-referencing commands in
LaTeX to produce hypertext links in the document.  The package
provides backends for the \special set defined for HyperTeX DVI
processors; for embedded pdfmark commands for processing by Acrobat
Distiller (dvips and Y&Y's dvipsone); for Y&Y's dviwindo; for PDF
control within pdfTeX and dvipdfm; for TeX4ht; and for VTeX's pdf and
HTML backends.  The package is distributed with the backref and
nameref packages, which make use of the facilities of hyperref.  The
package depends on the author's kvoptions and refcount packages.
