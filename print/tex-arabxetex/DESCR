ArabXeTeX provides a convenient ArabTeX-like user-interface for
typesetting languages using the Arabic script in XeLaTeX, with
flexible access to font features. Input in ArabTeX notation can
be set in three different vocalization modes or in roman
transliteration. Direct UTF-8 input is also supported. The
parsing and converting of ArabTeX input to Unicode is done by
means of TECkit mappings. Version 1.0 provides support for
Arabic, Maghribi Arabic, Farsi (Persian), Urdu, Sindhi,
Kashmiri, Ottoman Turkish, Kurdish, Jawi (Malay) and Uighur.
The documentation covers topics such as typesetting the Holy
Quran and typesetting bidirectional critical editions with the
package ednotes.
