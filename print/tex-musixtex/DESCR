MusixTeX is a set of TeX macros to typeset polyphonic, orchestral or
polyphonic music. 

This is the typical way one would process a MusixTeX file:

	musixtex foo
	musixflx foo
	musixtex foo

This will give you foo.dvi which then can be processed like any other
.dvi.  Use dvips to convert it into a postscript file or print it to a
Postscript printer.  Then ps2pdf may be used to convert the Postscript
file into a PDF file.

The full documentation of MusixTeX will be found in
${LOCALBASE}/share/texmf/doc/musixtex/.  It's highly recommended that
you either print out musixdoc.ps directly or use a PDF viewer to print
musixdoc.pdf and put the resulting hardcopy in a loose-leaf binder.
