Ghostscript is the well-known PostScript interpreter which is available for
all common and most esoteric platforms and supports many different printers
and some displays.

This package contains ESP Ghostscript, which is a separately maintained
distribution of GNU Ghostscript and distributed under the terms of the GNU
Public License.  ESP Ghostscript incorporates the CUPS raster printer
driver and a large number of contributed Ghostscript printer drivers.

Note that print/ghostscript now has cups support, and that this version is older.
Thus ghostscript-esp is deprecated and will be removed at some point.
