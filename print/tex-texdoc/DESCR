texdoc is a Lua script providing easy access to the
documentation in TeX Live: PDF, DVI, plain text files, and
more. Viewing and other configuration can be extensively
customized. It is distributed with TeX Live; MiKTeX provides a
program by the same name to do the same job, but its
implementation is unrelated.
