The original package extended the file name processing of
package graphics to support a larger range of file names. The
base LaTeX code now supports multiple dots and spaces, and this
package by default is a stub that just loads graphicx. However,
\usepackage{grffile}[=v1] may be used to access version 1(.18)
of the package if that is needed.
