The package defines a tabular*-like environment, tabulary,
taking a 'total width' argument as well as the column
specifications. The environment uses column types L, C, R and J
for variable width columns (\raggedright', \centering,
\raggedleft, and normally justified). In contrast to tabularx's
X columns, the width of each column is weighted according to
the natural width of the widest cell in the column.
