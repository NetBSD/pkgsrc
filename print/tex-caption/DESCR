The caption package provides many ways to customise the captions in
floating environments like figure and table, and cooperates with many
other packages.  Includes rotating captions, sideways captions,
continued captions (for tables or figures that come in several parts).
A list of compatibility notes, for other packages, is provided in the
documentation.  The package also provides the "caption outside float"
facility, in the same way that simpler packages like capt-of do.  The
package supersedes caption2.
