The bundle offers versions of the standard LaTeX article and
report classes, rewritten to reflect a more European design,
and the a4 package, which is better tuned to the shape of a4
paper than is the a4paper class option of the standard classes.
The classes include several for article and report
requirements, and a letter class. The elements of the bundle
were designed by members of the Dutch TeX Users Group NTG.
