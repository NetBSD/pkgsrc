  LilyPond is a music typesetter.  It produces beautiful sheet music using a
high level description file as input.  It excels at typesetting classical
music, but you can also print pop-songs.  With LilyPond we hope to make music
publication software available to anyone on the internet. 

  The input to LilyPond is plain text.  So, you can use your favorite text
editor to enter it, you can put it in mail or embed it in an article like
this: 

  \relative c'' { \key c \minor; r8 c16 b c8 g as c16 b c8 d | g,4 }

  The output looks very good: the font and the layout algorithms were inspired
by engraved music, so you can expect that same clear and elegant look from
your LilyPond output.  And if you don't like the looks, you can tweak almost
everything. 

  The program also has limited MIDI functionality: you can write MIDI files
with lilypond, and we have a simple MIDI to lilypond conversion tool, midi2ly.
Conversion tools for PMX, MUP, ABC, Finale and Musedata are also included. 

  LilyPond is free software. It is licensed under GNU General Public License,
so you can use, modify and redistribute the program with almost no
restrictions. LilyPond is part of the GNU Project.
