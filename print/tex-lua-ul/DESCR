This package provides underlining, strikethough, and
highlighting using features in LuaLaTeX which avoid the
restrictions imposed by other methods. In particular, kerning
is not affected, the underlined text can use arbitrary
commands, hyphenation works etc. The package requires LuaTeX
version 1.12.0.
