Package listings does not support files with multi-byte
encodings such as UTF-8. In the case of \lstinputlisting, a
simple workaround is possible if a one-byte encoding exists
that the file can be converted to. The package requires the
e-TeX extensions under pdfTeX (in either PDF or DVI output
mode).
