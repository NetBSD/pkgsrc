Heiko Oberdiek's makerobust package defined a command with name
\MakeRobustCommand that could be used to make fragile commands
robust. The LaTeX format has, since 2015, included a command
\MakeRobust with the same syntax and behaviour. Also by 2019,
almost all commands in LaTeX that may be used in a moving
argument are already robust. This package is now just a simple
one-liner defining the name \MakeRobustCommand as an alias for
\MakeRobust. This package should not be used in any new
documents.
