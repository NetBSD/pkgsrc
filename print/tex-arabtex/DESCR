ArabTeX is a package extending the capabilities of TeX/LaTeX to generate
Arabic and Hebrew text. Input may be in ASCII transliteration or other
encodings (including UTF-8); output may be Arabic, Hebrew, or any of
several languages that use the Arabic script. ArabTeX consists of a TeX
macro package and Arabic and Hebrew fonts (provided both in Metafont
format and Adobe Type 1). The Arabic font is presently only available in
the Naskhi style. ArabTeX will run with Plain TeX and also with LaTeX.
