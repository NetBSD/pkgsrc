Allows figures or tables to have text wrapped around them. Does not work
in combination with list environments, but can be used in a parbox or
minipage, and in twocolumn format. Supports the float package. Note that
most of the package documentation is contained in the package file
itself (after the \endinput command at the end of the package proper).
