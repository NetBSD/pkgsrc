The package allows the user to manually markup changes of text,
such as additions, deletions, or replacements. Changed text is
shown in a different color; deleted text is striked out.
Additionally, text can be highlighted and/or commented. The
package allows free definition of additional authors and their
associated color. It also allows you to change the markup of
changes, authors, highlights or comments. A bash script is
provided for removing the changes.
