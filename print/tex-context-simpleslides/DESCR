This ConTeXt module provides an easy-to-use interface for
creating presentations for use with a digital projector. The
presentations are not interactive (no buttons, hyperlinks or
navigational tools such as tables of contents). Graphics may be
mixed with the text of slides. The module provides several
predefined styles, designed for academic presentation. Most
styles are configurable, and it is easy to design new styles.
