This bundle holds optional files that are loaded in certain
situations by kernel code (if available). While this code is
still in development and the use is experimental, it is stored
outside the format so that there can be intermediate releases
not affecting the production use of LaTeX. Once the code is
finalized and properly tested it will eventually move to the
kernel and the corresponding file in this bundle will vanish.
Note that none of these files are directly user accessible in
documents (i.e., they aren't packages), so the process is
transparent to documents already using the new functionality.
