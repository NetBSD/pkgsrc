A converter from TeX and LaTeX to SGML-based formats such as
(X)HTML, MathML, OpenDocument, and DocBook, providing a
configurable (La)TeX-based authoring system for hypertext.
TeX4ht does not parse (La)TeX source (so that it avoids the
difficulties encountered by many other converters, arising from
the irregularity of (La)TeX syntax). Instead, TeX4ht uses
(La)TeX itself (with an extra macro package) to produce a
non-standard DVI file that it can then process. This technique
allows TeX4ht to approach the robustness characteristic of
restricted-syntax systems such as hyperlatex and gellmu. Note
that CTAN no longer holds the definitive sources of the
package: see the 'Readme' file.
