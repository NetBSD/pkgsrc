The package aims to solve the error "No room for a new \write",
which occurs when the user, or when the user's packages have
'allocated too many streams' using \newwrite (TeX has a fixed
maximum number - 16 - such streams built-in to its code). The
package hooks into TeX primitive commands associated with
writing to files; it should be loaded near the beginning of the
sequence of loading packages for a document.
