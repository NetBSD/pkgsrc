The Common UNIX Printing System provides a portable printing layer for
UNIX operating systems. It has been developed by Easy Software Products
to promote a standard printing solution for all UNIX vendors and users.
CUPS provides the System V and Berkeley command-line interfaces.

CUPS uses the Internet Printing Protocol (IETF-IPP) as the basis for
managing print jobs and queues.  The Line Printer Daemon (LPD, RFC1179)
and AppSocket protocols are also supported with reduced functionality.

CUPS adds network printer browsing and PostScript Printer Description
("PPD")-based printing options to support real world applications under
UNIX.

This package contains the older 1.5 series, before Apple stopped
maintaining the filters.
