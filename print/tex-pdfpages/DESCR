This package simplifies the inclusion of external multi-page
PDF documents in LaTeX documents. Pages may be freely selected
and similar to psnup it is possible to put several logical
pages onto each sheet of paper. Furthermore a lot of hypertext
features like hyperlinks and article threads are provided. The
package supports pdfTeX (pdfLaTeX) and VTeX. With VTeX it is
even possible to use this package to insert PostScript files,
in addition to PDF files.
