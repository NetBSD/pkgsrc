Because FAM uses RPC, you have to add the following line to the system's
portmapper file (/etc/rpc):

        sgi_fam    391002    fam    # File Alteration Monitor

Also make sure that the RPC port mapper is enabled by checking whether
rpcbind=YES is in /etc/rc.conf.  After that, restart the rpcbind(8) server.

Furthermore, you have to enable the FAM daemon.  There are two ways to do
this: through inetd(8) or as a standalone server.  If you prefer the former
way, add the following line to /etc/inetd.conf:

        sgi_fam/1-2 stream rpc/tcp wait root ${PREFIX}/sbin/famd famd

and reload inetd(8)'s daemon.  However, if you prefer the latter way, use
the provided famd rc.d(8) script.
