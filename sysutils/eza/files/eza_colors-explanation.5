.SH Eza Color Explanation
eza provides its own built-in set of file extension mappings that cover
a large range of common file extensions, including documents, archives,
media, and temporary files.
Any mappings in the environment variables will override this default
set: running eza with \f[CR]LS_COLORS=\[dq]*.zip=32\[dq]\f[R] will turn
zip files green but leave the colours of other compressed files alone.
.PP
You can also disable this built-in set entirely by including a
\f[CR]reset\f[R] entry at the beginning of \f[CR]EZA_COLORS\f[R].
So setting \f[CR]EZA_COLORS=\[dq]reset:*.txt=31\[dq]\f[R] will highlight
only text files; setting \f[CR]EZA_COLORS=\[dq]reset\[dq]\f[R] will
highlight nothing.

as compiled when next to styles.less or styles.sass, and scripts.js when
next to scripts.ts or scripts.coffee.
