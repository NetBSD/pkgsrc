Subject: x86/hvm: Fix the handling of non-present segments

In 32bit, the data segments may be NULL to indicate that the segment is
ineligible for use.  In both 32bit and 64bit, the LDT selector may be NULL to
indicate that the entire LDT is ineligible for use.  However, nothing in Xen
actually checks for this condition when performing other segmentation
checks.  (Note however that limit and writeability checks are correctly
performed).

Neither Intel nor AMD specify the exact behaviour of loading a NULL segment.
Experimentally, AMD zeroes all attributes but leaves the base and limit
unmodified.  Intel zeroes the base, sets the limit to 0xfffffff and resets the
attributes to just .G and .D/B.

The use of the segment information in the VMCB/VMCS is equivalent to a native
pipeline interacting with the segment cache.  The present bit can therefore
have a subtly different meaning, and it is now cooked to uniformly indicate
whether the segment is usable or not.

GDTR and IDTR don't have access rights like the other segments, but for
consistency, they are treated as being present so no special casing is needed
elsewhere in the segmentation logic.

AMD hardware does not consider the present bit for %cs and %tr, and will
function as if they were present.  They are therefore unconditionally set to
present when reading information from the VMCB, to maintain the new meaning of
usability.

Intel hardware has a separate unusable bit in the VMCS segment attributes.
This bit is inverted and stored in the present field, so the hvm code can work
with architecturally-common state.

This is XSA-191.
