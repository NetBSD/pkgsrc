xosview2 is the experimental new branch of the xosview system monitor.

xosview is a lightweight program that gathers information from your
operating system and displays it in graphical form. It attempts to show
you in a quick glance an overview of how your system resources are
being utilized.

It can be configured to be nothing more than a small strip showing a
couple of parameters on a desktop task bar. Or it can display dozens of
meters and rolling graphical charts over your entire screen.

Since xosview renders all graphics with core X11 drawing methods, you
can run it on one machine and display it on another. This works even if
your other host is an operating system not running an X server inside a
virtual machine running on a physically different host. If you can
connect to it on a network, then you can popup an xosview instance and
monitor what is going on.
