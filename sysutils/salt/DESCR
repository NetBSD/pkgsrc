Salt is a distributed remote execution system used to execute commands
and query data. It was developed in order to bring the best solutions
found in the world of remote execution together and make them better,
faster and more malleable. Salt accomplishes this via its ability to
handle larger loads of information, and not just dozens, but hundreds,
or even thousands of individual servers. It handles them quickly and
through a simple yet manageable interface.
