These tools allow you to access Macintosh disks without mounting
them. You can copy from or to BSD files, list directories, or run
various other file / directory modification commands. The command
naming is similar to that used by the mtools command (which is
similar to MS-DOS command names), except that the names begin with
an 'h'.

This package installs only the traditional "Command Line Tools"
from Rob Mars' HFS Utilities. The advanced Tcl shell and Tk GUI
are packaged independently, as the sysutils/xhfs package.
