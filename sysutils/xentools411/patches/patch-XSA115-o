Subject: tools/ocaml/xenstored: ignore transaction id for [un]watch
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Instead of ignoring the transaction id for XS_WATCH and XS_UNWATCH
commands as it is documented in docs/misc/xenstore.txt, it is tested
for validity today.

Really ignore the transaction id for XS_WATCH and XS_UNWATCH.

This is part of XSA-115.

Subject: tools/ocaml/xenstored: introduce permissions for special watches
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The special watches "@introduceDomain" and "@releaseDomain" should be
allowed for privileged callers only, as they allow to gain information
about presence of other guests on the host. So send watch events for
those watches via privileged connections only.

Start to address this by treating the special watches as regular nodes
in the tree, which gives them normal semantics for permissions.  A later
change will restrict the handling, so that they can't be listed, etc.

Subject: tools/ocaml/xenstored: avoid watch events for nodes without access
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Today watch events are sent regardless of the access rights of the
node the event is sent for. This enables any guest to e.g. setup a
watch for "/" in order to have a detailed record of all Xenstore
modifications.

Modify that by sending only watch events for nodes that the watcher
has a chance to see otherwise (either via direct reads or by querying
the children of a node). This includes cases where the visibility of
a node for a watcher is changing (permissions being removed).

Permissions for nodes are looked up either in the old (pre
transaction/command) or current trees (post transaction).  If
permissions are changed multiple times in a transaction only the final
version is checked, because considering a transaction atomic the
individual permission changes would not be noticable to an outside
observer.

Two trees are only needed for set_perms: here we can either notice the
node disappearing (if we loose permission), appearing
(if we gain permission), or changing (if we preserve permission).

RM needs to only look at the old tree: in the new tree the node would be
gone, or could have different permissions if it was recreated (the
recreation would get its own watch fired).

Inside a tree we lookup the watch path's parent, and then the watch path
child itself.  This gets us 4 sets of permissions in worst case, and if
either of these allows a watch, then we permit it to fire.  The
permission lookups are done without logging the failures, otherwise we'd
get confusing errors about permission denied for some paths, but a watch
still firing. The actual result is logged in xenstored-access log:

  'w event ...' as usual if watch was fired
  'w notfired...' if the watch was not fired, together with path and
  permission set to help in troubleshooting

Adding a watch bypasses permission checks and always fires the watch
once immediately. This is consistent with the specification, and no
information is gained (the watch is fired both if the path exists or
doesn't, and both if you have or don't have access, i.e. it reflects the
path a domain gave it back to that domain).

There are some semantic changes here:

  * Write+rm in a single transaction of the same path is unobservable
    now via watches: both before and after a transaction the path
    doesn't exist, thus both tree lookups come up with the empty
    permission set, and noone, not even Dom0 can see this. This is
    consistent with transaction atomicity though.
  * Similar to above if we temporarily grant and then revoke permission
    on a path any watches fired inbetween are ignored as well
  * There is a new log event (w notfired) which shows the permission set
    of the path, and the path.
  * Watches on paths that a domain doesn't have access to are now not
    seen, which is the purpose of the security fix.

This is part of XSA-115.

Subject: tools/ocaml/xenstored: add xenstored.conf flag to turn off watch
 permission checks
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

There are flags to turn off quotas and the permission system, so add one
that turns off the newly introduced watch permission checks as well.

This is part of XSA-115.
