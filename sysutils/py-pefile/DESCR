pefile is a multi-platform Python module to read and work with Portable
Executable (aka PE) files. Most of the information in the PE Header is
accessible, as well as all the sections, section's information and data.

pefile requires some basic understanding of the layout of a PE file. Armed with
it it's possible to explore nearly every single feature of the file.

Some of the tasks that pefile makes possible are:

 * Modifying and writing back to the PE image
 * Header Inspection
 * Sections analysis
 * Retrieving data
 * Warnings for suspicious and malformed values
 * Packer detection with PEiD's signatures
 * PEiD signature generation
