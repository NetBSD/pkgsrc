    Lavaps is an interactive process-tracking program like ``top'',
    but with a much different attitude. Rather than presenting lots of
    specific info in digital form, it tries to present certain important
    information in a graphical analog form. The idea is that you can
    run it in the background and get a rough idea of what's happening
    to your system without devoting much concentration to the task.
