xcp is a partial clone of the Unix cp command. It is not intended as a full
replacement, but as a companion utility with some more user-friendly feedback
and some optimisations that make sense under certain tasks.

Warning: xcp is currently beta-level software and almost certainly contains
bugs and unexpected or inconsistent behaviour. It probably shouldn't be used for
anything critical yet.
