nbase is a collection of NetBSD tools portable to Linux, MacOS-X and other
UNIX-like systems. Its version looks like x.y.z.n, where x is a NetBSD major
version, y -- NetBSD minor version, z -- NetBSD patch level, and n -- nbase
release number. For example, 7.0.0.4 means fourth release of nbase that
corresponds to NetBSD 7.0-RELEASE.
