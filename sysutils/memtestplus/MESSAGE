Memtest86+ is a standalone program, it does not run within an operating
system.  It has been designed to boot from a PC floppy disk.  To install
Memtest86 on a floppy, insert a disk then type:
	dd if=${PREFIX}/mdec/memtestplus.bin of=/dev/rfd0a conv=osync

The package also includes the ELF binary ${PREFIX}/mdec/memtestplus
that the NetBSD bootstrap can load instead of a kernel. Please see
boot(8) for details. If your ${PREFIX}/mdec directory is not on the
root filesystem you need to copy the ELF binary there first.

If you have built the optional .iso file, you can use cdrtools to
burn it to a CD.

The documentation claims that the .bin file can be booted by LILO; I have
not tested that.

Please read the documentation at:
	${PREFIX}/share/doc/memtestplus/README
	${PREFIX}/share/doc/memtestplus/FAQ
	http://www.memtest.org
