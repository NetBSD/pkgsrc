.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a utility to build
.Nx
releases in a fully automated manner.
The process is made unattended by relying on a configuration file that
prespecifies the location of all build components and the desired goals of
the build.
If you want to plug
.Nm
into
.Xr cron 8 ,
please take a look to
.Xr sysbuild4cron 1
now.
.Pp
.Nm
can be seen as a simple wrapper over
.Xr cvs 1
and the
.Nm build.sh
script that ships with the
.Nx
source tree.
.Nm
provides the following additional features:
.Bl -bullet
.It
Automatically fetch or update the
.Nx
source trees (both src and xsrc)
before performing a build.
.It
Preconfigure the way
.Nm build.sh
is invoked by storing all relevant details in a configuration file.
.It
Perform builds for a variety of platforms with a single invocation.
.It
Trivially set up periodic
.Nx
rebuilds by adding a single line to your
.Xr crontab 5 .
.El
.Pp
As you can see in the
.Sx SYNOPSIS
section,
.Nm
provides a subcommand-interface: the tool has several modes of operation,
and the particular mode to use for a given run is selected by the first
non-option argument in the command line.
.Pp
The following options apply to all commands:
.Bl -tag -width XXXX
.It Fl c Ar config_name
Specifies the configuration file to use.
.Pp
If
.Ar config_name
includes any directory separator (aka, one or more slashes) or the
.Sq .conf
suffix, then this specifies the path of the configuration file to load.
.Pp
.If
.Ar config_name
is a plain name without any directory components nor extension, then this
specifies the name of the configuration.
.Nm
will first look for a configuration file in
.Pa ~/.sysbuild/<config_name>.conf
and, if not found, will use
.Pa @SYSBUILD_ETCDIR@/<config_name>.conf .
Any of the two files must exist, or else
.Nm
will exit with an error.
.It Fl o Ar variable=value
Applies an override to the loaded configuration.
.Pp
The
.Ar variable
part of the argument must be any of the recognized configuration variables
described in
.Sx Configuration file
below.
The
.Ar value ,
if not empty, specifies the value to set the configuration variable to.
If
.Ar value
is empty, then the configuration variable is unset.
.El
.Ss The build command
The build command provides the main functionality of
.Nm .
It performs the following steps:
.Bl -enum
.It
If
.Va UPDATE_SOURCES
is true, the fetch command is invoked first.
See
.Sx The fetch command
for more details.
.It
For every machine type listed in
.Va MACHINES ,
issues a
.Nm build.sh
call for that particular machine using the rest of the settings defined in
the configuration file.
The targets passed to the
.Nm build.sh
script are those defined in the
.Va BUILD_TARGETS
variable, or the arguments passed through the command line if any.
.El
.Pp
The following options apply only to the build command:
.Bl -tag -width XXXX
.It Fl f
Enables fast mode, which skips updating the source trees and performs
update builds.
This is a shorthand for these generic flags:
.Fl o Ar INCREMENTAL_BUILD=true
.Fl o Ar UPDATE_SOURCES=false .
.El
.Ss The config command
The config command dumps the loaded configuration to the standard output.
The format of the output is not a script, so it cannot be fed back into
.Nm .
The purpose of this command is to aid in debugging the configuration of the
tool before performing any builds, particularly when the configuration
files use shell logic to determine the value of any variables.
.Ss The fetch command
The fetch command downloads or updates the
.Nx
source trees, which include src and, optionally, xsrc.
.Pp
If the modules do not exist yet in the locations specified by
.Va SRCDIR
and
.Va XSRCDIR ,
this performs an initial CVS checkout of the trees.
If the modules exist, this performs a CVS update.
.Pp
The
.Va CVSROOT
and
.Va CVSTAG
variables are used to determine where to get the sources from and whether a
particular tag is desired.
.Pp
The major use of this subcommand is the following.
Consider that you wish to use the standard locations of
.Pa /usr/src
and
.Pa /usr/xsrc
for your source trees, and that you would like to keep these owned by root
while, at the same time, you run your
.Nx
builds as an unprivileged user.
In this situation, you can use the
.Sq fetch
command as root only, set
.Va UPDATE_SOURCES
to
.Sq false
in your user configuration files, and do your builds as another user.
.Ss Configuration file
Configuration files for
.Nm
are plain shell scripts that define a set of recognized variables.
.Pp
As scripts, they can perform any magic they desire to deduce the value of
the configuration variables.
For example, the default configuration file shipped with
.Nm
automatically deduces the value of the
.Va NJOBS
variable by looking at how many CPUs are available in the system.
.Pp
The following variables configure the source trees:
.Bl -tag -width INCREMENTAL_BUILD
.It Va CVSROOT
Location of the CVS root from which to check out or update the src and xsrc
modules.
.Pp
Default:
.Sq :ext:anoncvs@anoncvs.NetBSD.org:/cvsroot
.It Va CVSTAG
CVS tag to use during checkouts or updates of the src and xsrc modules.
.Pp
Default: not defined.
.It Va SRCDIR
Path to the src module.
If you want
.Nm
to perform an update of this directory before every build, you will need
write access to it.
Otherwise, you can use a read-only directory.
.Pp
Default:
.Pa /usr/src .
.It Va UPDATE_SOURCES
Whether to perform an update of the source tree before every build or not.
.Pp
Default:
.Sq true .
.It Va XSRCDIR
Path to the xsrc module.
If you want
.Nm
to perform an update of this directory before every build, you will need
write access to it.
Otherwise, you can use a read-only directory.
.Pp
Defining this variable causes
.Nm
to build the X Window System as part of the build of
.Nx .
.Pp
Default: not defined.
.El
.Pp
The following variables configure the location of the build files:
.Bl -tag -width INCREMENTAL_BUILD
.It Va BUILD_ROOT
Path to the directory in which to place build files.
These include the obj tree, the destdir and the cross-build tools generated
by the
.Nm build.sh
script.
The contents of this directory are sorted by machine type so that it can be
shared across builds for different machines.
.Pp
Default:
.Pa ~/sysbuild/ .
.It Va RELEASEDIR
Path to the directory that will contain the build products (aka the release
files).
The contents of this directory are sorted by machine type so that it can be
shared across builds for different machines.
.Pp
Default:
.Pa ~/sysbuild/release .
.El
.Pp
The following variables configure the build process:
.Bl -tag -width INCREMENTAL_BUILD
.It Va BUILD_TARGETS
Whitespace-separated list of targets to pass to
.Nm build.sh
during builds.
.Pp
Default:
.Sq release .
.It Va INCREMENTAL_BUILD
Whether to perform update builds or not.
An update build reuses existing obj, destdir and tools trees.
.Pp
Of special note is that
.Nm
will take care of pruning files likely to cause breakage during update
builds before performing the build itself.
As an example, this includes deleting all the modules from
.Pa destdir/stand/<platform>/ .
.Pp
Default:
.Sq false .
.It Va MACHINES
Whitespace-separated list of machine types to build for.
.Pp
Default: the name of the host machine type.
.It Va NJOBS
Number of parallel jobs to use during the build.
If not set, disables parallel builds (which, due to
.Nm make 1
semantics, is not the same as setting this to 1).
.Pp
Default: not defined.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width XXXX
.It Pa @SYSBUILD_ETCDIR@/
Directory containing all system-wide configuration files.
.It Pa @SYSBUILD_ETCDIR@/default.conf
Default configuration file to load if the user does not have a
corresponding
.Pa ~/.sysbuild/default.conf
file and the
.Fl c
flag is not provided.
.It Pa ~/.sysbuild/
Directory containing all user-specific configuration files.
.It Pa ~/.sysbuild/default.conf
Default configuration file to load when the
.Fl c
flag is not provided.
