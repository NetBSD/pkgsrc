This package provides a drop-in alternative to subprocess.run that captures the
output while still printing it in real-time, just the way tee does.

Printing output in real-time while still capturing is valuable for any tool
that executes long-running child processes. For those, you do want to provide
instant feedback (progress) related to what is happening.
