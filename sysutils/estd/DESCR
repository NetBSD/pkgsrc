The estd daemon dynamically sets the CPU-frequency on
SpeedStep-enabled CPUs depending on current cpu-utilization.  It is
written for systems running NetBSD.

Examples:

Maximize battery lifetime by limiting CPU-frequency to 1000 MHz and
switching to lower speeds fast:

	estd -d -b -M 1000

Maximize performance by running at least at 1400MHz and switching to
higher speeds real fast:

	estd -d -a -m 1400
