Gamin is a file and directory monitoring system defined to be a subset
of the FAM (File Alteration Monitor) system.

The main goals of the project are:

   1. Minimize the security model of FAM -- the daemon runs under the
      user account.
   2. Simplify the code base, dropping some of the most exotic features
      of FAM.
   3. Provide an API and ABI compatible replacement for FAM.
   4. Try to fix some other issues like resource consumption.

This package provides the Gamin server.
