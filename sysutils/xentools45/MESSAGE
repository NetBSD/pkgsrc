Please note that the xm command has been removed.
You have to switch to the xl command, which is now functional on NetBSD.

Also note that the rc.d scripts have been updated in this version.
If you don't use PKG_RCD_SCRIPTS=YES then it is very important for
you to copy the new rc.d scripts to /etc/rc.d.
