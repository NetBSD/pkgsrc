Network UPS Tools can monitor a large assortment of UPS hardware.
Network communications are used so that multiple systems can monitor a
single physical UPS and shut down together if necessary without any
special "sharing hardware" on the UPS itself.

There are additional ups-nut-* packages for cgi, SNMP, and USB
support.
