# The standard approach is to leave "upsdriver_type" unset, so that
# upsdrvctl is used to start and stop the driver(s).  (Note that a
# system might have more than one UPS, and upsdrvctl should support
# this.)  See nutupsdrv(8), but upsdrvctl will invoke the driver
# properly.
#
# An alternative is to set the driver type and flags.  This only works
# for a single driver.  This approach is deprecated and may be removed.
