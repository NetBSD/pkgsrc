This module implements an interface to the Linux 2.6.13 and later Inotify
file/directory change notification sytem.

It has a number of advantages over the Linux::Inotify module:
    - it is portable (Linux::Inotify only works on x86)
    - the equivalent of fullname works correctly
    - it is better documented
    - it has callback-style interface, which is better suited for
      integration.
