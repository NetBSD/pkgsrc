gvfs is a userspace virtual filesystem designed to work with the i/o
abstractions of gio (a library availible in glib >= 2.15.1). It
installs several modules that are automatically used by applications
using the APIs of libgio. There is also fuse support that allows
applications not using gio to access the gvfs filesystems.
