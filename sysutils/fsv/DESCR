fsv (pronounced eff-ess-vee) is a file system visualizer in cyberspace. 
It lays out files and directories in three dimensions, geometrically 
representing the file system hierarchy to allow visual overview and 
analysis. fsv can visualize a modest home directory, a workstation's 
hard drive, or any arbitrarily large collection of files, limited only 
by the host computer's memory and graphics hardware.
