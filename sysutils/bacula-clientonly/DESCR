Bacula is a set of computer programs that permit you (or the system
administrator) to manage backup, recovery, and verification of computer data
across a network of computers of different kinds. In technical terms, it is
a network client/server based backup program. Bacula is relatively easy to
use and efficient, while offering many advanced storage management features
that make it easy to find and recover lost or damaged files. Bacula source
code has been released under the GPL version 2 license.

This package provides a client-only setup (the bacula file daemon and
console).  For a complete setup (including the bacula director and storage
daemon) you should install the bacula package.
