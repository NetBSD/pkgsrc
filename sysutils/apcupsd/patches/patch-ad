+# This piece is to substitute the default behaviour with your own script,
+# perl, or C program.
+# You can customize every single command creating an executable file (may be a
+# script or a compiled program) and calling it the same as the $1 parameter
+# passed by apcupsd to this script.
+#
+# After executing your script, apccontrol continues with the default action.
+# If you do not want apccontrol to continue, exit your script with exit 
+# code 99. E.g. "exit 99".
+#
+# WARNING: the apccontrol file will be overwritten every time you update your
+# apcupsd, doing `make install'. Your own customized scripts will _not_ be
+# overwritten. If you wish to make changes to this file (discouraged), you
+# should change apccontrol.sh.in and then rerun the configure process.
