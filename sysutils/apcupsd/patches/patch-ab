-# "apcupsd" POSIX config file
-#
-#  If you have used a prior version of apcupsd, the CONTROL script file
-#  (/sbin/powersc) has now been replaced by /etc/apcupsd/apccontrol.
-#  Consequently, the CONTROL configuration statement is obsolete.
-#  The following configuration statements have been replaced by scripts
-#  called from /etc/apcupsd/apccontrol, and thus are obsolete:
-#  BATTCMD, LIMITCMN, LOADCMD, PWRCMD, REBOOTCMD, REMOTECMD, RETCMD,
-#  and TIMECMD.
