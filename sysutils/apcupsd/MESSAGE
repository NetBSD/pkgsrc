NOTE:  You may use the (undocumented) NISIP configuration file option to
       determine what interfaces the NIS server will listen on; use
       "NISIP 127.0.0.1" for better security.

NOTE:  With NetBSD 4.0 and higher, you can leave USB HID devices enabled,
       but force a single port to attach ugen instead (for the UPS) with
       a kernel configuration line along the lines of:
           ugen*   at uhub0 port 1 flags 1

NOTE:  With most APC cables you must put a "local" flag in /etc/ttys for
       the port you connect your UPS to, and run "ttyflags -a" to turn it
       on the first time.
