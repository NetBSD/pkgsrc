ARM Trusted Firmware (ATF) provides a reference implementation of secure
world software for ARMv8-A, including a Secure Monitor executing at
Exception Level 3 (EL3). It implements various ARM interface standards,
such as:

    The Power State Coordination Interface (PSCI)
    Trusted Board Boot Requirements (TBBR, ARM DEN0006C-1)
    SMC Calling Convention
    System Control and Management Interface

As far as possible the code is designed for reuse or porting to other
ARMv8-A model and hardware platforms.

ARM will continue development in collaboration with interested parties to
provide a full reference implementation of Secure Monitor code and ARM
standards to the benefit of all developers working with ARMv8-A TrustZone
technology.

This package provides mainline ATF for the RockChip RK3328 platform,
for example used by u-boot for the Pine64's Rock64.
