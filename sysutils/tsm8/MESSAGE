$NetBSD: MESSAGE,v 1.2 2021/05/20 19:24:13 hauke Exp $

Tivoli Storage Manager Client has been installed in
		${EMULDIR}/opt/tivoli
with binaries in
		${EMULDIR}/opt/tivoli/tsm/client/ba/bin
and configuration in
		${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}

NetBSD configuration hints:

- TSM expects ${EMULDIR}/etc/mtab to exist, and be meaningful.
  The suse_base package sets up a symlink to ${EMULDIR}/proc/mounts,
  which works on NetBSD 3 or newer if you mount procfs like
  >> procfs  ${EMULDIR}/linux/proc  procfs  ro,linux  0 0 <<
  in /etc/fstab.
  Alternatively, make ${EMULDIR}/etc/mtab a symlink to /etc/fstab.

- Make sure 'passworddir' is set in tsm.sys, so that the passwd file
  ends up in ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR} instead of the shadow hierarchy.

- The environment variables DSM_DIR, DSM_CONFIG, DSM_LOG
  need to be set properly. DSM_LOG may inadvertently end up in the emul
  shadow hierarchy.
  There is a sample start script in ${PREFIX}/share/examples/tsm.

- For backing up the native filesystem hierarchy, use a construct
  like "ln -s / /.`hostname`" to break out of the emul shadow hierarchy.
