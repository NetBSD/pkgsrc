Podman (the POD MANager) is a tool for managing containers and
images, volumes mounted into those containers, and pods made from
groups of containers. Podman is based on libpod, a library for
container lifecycle management that is also contained in this
repository. The libpod library provides APIs for managing containers,
pods, container images, and volumes.

On operating systems other than Linux, it can spawn and talk to a
Linux virtual machine.
