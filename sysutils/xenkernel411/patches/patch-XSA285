Subject: IOMMU/x86: fix type ref-counting race upon IOMMU page table construction

When arch_iommu_populate_page_table() gets invoked for an already
running guest, simply looking at page types once isn't enough, as they
may change at any time. Add logic to re-check the type after having
mapped the page, unmapping it again if needed.

This is XSA-285.
