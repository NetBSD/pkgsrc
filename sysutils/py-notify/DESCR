Py-notify is a Python package providing tools for implementing `Observer
programming pattern`.  These tools include signals, conditions and variables.
        
Signals are lists of handlers that are called when signal is emitted. Conditions
are basically boolean variables coupled with a signal that is emitted when
condition state changes. They can be combined using standard logical operators
(*not*, *and*, etc.) into compound conditions. Variables, unlike conditions, can
hold any Python object, not just booleans, but they cannot be combined.
