GnuCash is designed to be easy to use, yet powerful and flexible.
It allows you to track bank accounts, stocks, income and expenses.
As quick and intuitive to use as a checkbook register, it is based
on professional accounting principles to ensure balanced books and
accurate reports. It is extensible in guile (an embedded scheme
interpreter).

This package contains the older GTK1 version. For the current
version, look in finance/gnucash.
