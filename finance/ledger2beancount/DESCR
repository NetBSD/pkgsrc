A script to automatically convert ledger-based textual ledgers
(finance/ledger) to beancount-based ones (finance/py-beancount).

Conversion is based on (concrete) syntax, so that information that is
not meaningful for accounting reasons but still valuable (e.g.,
comments, formatting, etc.) can be preserved.
