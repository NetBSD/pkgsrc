# XXX Kludge: We need to run this in a UTF-8 locale; otherwise GHC is
# unhappy.  But we also need to make this override the C locale that
# pkgsrc tries hard to ensure everything gets built in for the sake of
# reproducibility, so it has to come _after_ bsd.pkg.mk.  This would be
# C.UTF-8, but C.UTF-8 was only recently introduced into NetBSD, so
# let's pick a locale that is pretty universally supported even if not
# exactly appropriate for this.
MAKE_ENV+=	LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
# The root cause of the problem is in hledger-lib/Hledger/Utils.hs
# (embedFileRelative). It uses embedStringFile from file-embed
# (devel/hs-file-embed) but without changing the locale encoding to
# UTF-8, and the file to be embedded
# (hledger/embeddedfiles/hledger.info) does contain non-ASCII
# characters. Using with-utf8
# (http://hackage.haskell.org/package/with-utf8) is probably the best
# solution.
