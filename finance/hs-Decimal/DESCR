Haskell-Decimal
===============

Fixed-precision decimal numbers, where the precision is carried with
the numbers at run-time.

The `Decimal` type is mainly intended for doing financial arithmetic
where the number of decimal places may not be known at compile time
(e.g. for a program that handles both Yen and Dollars) and the
application must not drop pennies on the floor.  For instance if you
have to divide $10 between three people then one of them has to get
$3.34.

The number of decimal places in a value is represented as a Word8,
allowing for up to 255 decimal places.  Functions preserve precision.
Addition and subtraction operators return a result with the precision
of the most precise argument, so 2.3 + 5.678 = 7.978. Multiplication
and division use whatever precision is necessary up to 255 decimal
places.
