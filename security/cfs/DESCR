CFS pushes encryption services into the UN*X file system.  It supports
secure storage at the system level through a standard UN*X file system
interface to encrypted files.  Users associate a cryptographic key with the
directories they wish to protect.  Files in these directories (as well as
their pathname components) are transparently encrypted and decrypted with
the specified key without further user intervention; cleartext is never
stored on a  disk or sent to a remote file server.  CFS employs a novel
combination of DES stream and codebook cipher modes to provide high
security with good performance on a modern workstation.  CFS can use any
available file system for its underlying storage without modification,
including remote file servers such as NFS.  System management functions,
such as file backup, work in a normal manner and without knowledge of the
key.
