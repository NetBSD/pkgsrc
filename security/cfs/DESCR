CFS pushes encryption services into the UN*X file system.  It
supports secure storage at the system level through a standard UN*X
file system interface to encrypted files.  Users associate a
cryptographic key with the directories they wish to protect.  Files
in these directories (as well as their pathname components) are
transparently encrypted and decrypted with the specified key without
further user intervention; cleartext is never stored on a  disk or
sent to a remote file server.  CFS employs a novel combination of
DES stream and codebook cipher modes to provide high security with
good performance on a modern workstation.  CFS can use any available
file system for its underlying storage without modification,
including remote file servers such as NFS.  System management
functions, such as file backup, work in a normal manner and without
knowledge of the key.

This is a continuation fork which does not currently intend to make
substantial changes, but is buildable on modern systems.
