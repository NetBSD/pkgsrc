The problem turns out to be NFS blocksize -- I got the idea from some
other discussions about problems caused by the change in the default
blocksize.  The fix is to use the following mount command:

        mount -o intr,-2,-w=4096,-r=4096 127.0.0.1:/null /crypt

8192 doesn't work; I haven't yet groveled through the CFS source to
figure out why.
