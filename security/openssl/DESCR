The OpenSSL Project is a collaborative effort to develop a
robust, commercial-grade, full-featured, and Open Source
toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)
and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols as well as
a full-strength general purpose cryptography library. The
project is managed by a worldwide community of volunteers
that use the Internet to communicate, plan, and develop the
OpenSSL toolkit and its related documentation.
