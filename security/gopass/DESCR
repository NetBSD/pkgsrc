gopass is a rewrite of the pass password manager in Go with the aim of
making it cross-platform and adding additional features.  Our target
audience are professional developers and sysadmins (and especially teams of
those) who are well versed with a command line interface.  One explicit
goal for this project is to make it more approachable to non-technical
users.  We go by the UNIX philosophy and try to do one thing and do it
well, providing a stellar user experience and a sane, simple interface.
