This package configures the Mozilla rootcerts bundle CAs as trust
anchors in OpenSSL, so that programs using OpenSSL will be able to use
them to validate SSL certificates.

For pkgsrc-provided OpenSSL, this package operates modifies
${PREFIX}/etc/ssl/certs as installed by another package.  This is
somewhat irregular as packages should not modify content under etc.

For native OpenSSL, it modifies the base system OpenSSL certificate
directory, e.g. /etc/openssl/certs or /etc/ssl/certs.  This is
necessary to configure trust anchors for native OpenSSL, so that
progams in pkgsrc can use these CA certs in validation.  Modification
of /etc is very irregular as pkgsrc should not write anything outside
of ${PREFIX}.

See also the mozilla-rootcerts package (which this one depends on) for
placing the Mozilla CA list in the filesystem but not configuring it
into OpenSSL.
