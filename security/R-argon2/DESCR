Utilities for secure password hashing via the argon2 algorithm. It is
a relatively new hashing algorithm and is believed to be very secure.
The 'argon2' implementation included in the package is the reference
implementation.  The package also includes some utilities that should
be useful for digest authentication, including a wrapper of 'blake2b'.
For similar R packages, see sodium and 'bcrypt'.  See
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2> or
