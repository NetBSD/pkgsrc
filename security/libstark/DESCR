The libSTARK library implements scalable and transparent argument of
knowledge (STARK) systems.  These systems can be executed with, or
without, zero knowledge (ZK), and may be designed as either
interactive or non-interactive protocols.  The theoretical
constructions which this library implements are described in detail in
the zk-STARK paper:
