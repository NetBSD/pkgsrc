OAuth::TTY

A TTY Command Line Interface for interacting with OAuth 1.0 services.

This library was written originally by Thiago Pinto in 2016 and bundled with
the oauth gem.  It was extracted into a separate library by Peter Boling in
2022 as part of the move to a stable version 1.0 for the oauth gem.
