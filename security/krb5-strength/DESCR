krb5-strength provides a password quality plugin for the MIT Kerberos KDC
(specifically the kadmind server) and Heimdal KDC, an external password
quality program for use with Heimdal, and a per-principal password history
implementation for Heimdal. Passwords can be tested with CrackLib, checked
against a CDB or SQLite database of known weak passwords with some
transformations, checked for length, checked for non-printable or non-ASCII
characters that may be difficult to enter reproducibly, required to contain
particular character classes, or any combination of these tests.
