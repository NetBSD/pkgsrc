mkcert is a simple tool for making locally-trusted development
certificates. It requires no configuration.

Using certificates from real certificate authorities (CAs) for
development can be dangerous or impossible (for hosts like localhost or
127.0.0.1), but self-signed certificates cause trust errors. Managing
your own CA is the best solution, but usually involves arcane commands,
specialized knowledge and manual steps.

mkcert automatically creates and installs a local CA in the system root
store, and generates locally-trusted certificates. mkcert does not
automatically configure servers to use the certificates, though, that's
up to you.
