Chef-Vault

Chef-Vault allows you to encrypt a Chef Data Bag Item using the public keys
of a list of chef nodes. This allows only those chef nodes to decrypt the
encrypted values.

For a more detailed explanation of how chef-vault works, please refer to
this blog post Chef Vault - what is it and what can it do for you? by Nell
Shamrell-Harrington.
