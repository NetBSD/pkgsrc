The Sleuth Kit (TSK) is a library and collection of command line tools that
allow you to investigate disk images. The core functionality of TSK allows
you to analyze volume and file system data. The plug-in framework allows
you to incorporate additional modules to analyze file contents and build
automated systems. The library can be incorporated into larger digital
forensics tools and the command line tools can be directly used to find
evidence.
