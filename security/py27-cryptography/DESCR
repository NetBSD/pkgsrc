cryptography is a package designed to expose cryptographic recipes
and primitives to Python developers.  Our goal is for it to be your
"cryptographic standard library".

cryptography includes both high level recipes, and low level
interfaces to common cryptographic algorithms such as symmetric
ciphers, message digests and key derivation functions.

This package contains the last version that does not use Rust.
