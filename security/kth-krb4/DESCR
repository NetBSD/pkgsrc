This is a severly hacked up version of Eric Young's eBones-p9 kerberos
version. The DES library has been updated with his 3.23 version and
numerous patches collected over the years have been applied to both
the kerberos and DES sources, most notably the CMU patches for extended
lifetimes that AFS uses. There is also support for AFS built into most
programs.
