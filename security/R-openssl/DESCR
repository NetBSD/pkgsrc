Bindings to OpenSSL libssl and libcrypto, plus custom SSH key parsers.
Supports RSA, DSA and EC curves P-256, P-384, P-521, and curve25519.
Cryptographic signatures can either be created and verified manually
or via x509 certificates. AES can be used in cbc, ctr or gcm mode for
symmetric encryption; RSA for asymmetric (public key) encryption or EC
for Diffie Hellman. High-level envelope functions combine RSA and AES
for encrypting arbitrary sized data. Other utilities include key
generators, hash functions (md5, sha1, sha256, etc), base64 encoder, a
secure random number generator, and 'bignum' math methods for manually
performing crypto calculations on large multibyte integers.
