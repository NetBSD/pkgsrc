This package provides the certificates distributed by the Mozilla
Project.  It also provides a script, mozilla-rootcerts, which can be
used to install the root CA certificates distributed by the Mozilla
Project into a location that makes them usable by OpenSSL and other
TLS implementations, and rehash the existing certificates.

NB: This package provides certificates, but does not as a consequence
of installation configure them as trust anchors in any particular
SSL/TLS implementation.  See the mozilla-rootcerts script for a way to
configure them.  See also mozilla-rootcerts-openssl for a package that
configures these certificates as trust anchors upon installation.
