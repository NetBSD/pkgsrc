This package provides a script which can be used to extract the root
CA certificates distributed by the Mozilla Project into the current
working directory and to rehash the existing certificates.  The directory
can be used by most SSL-aware programs that expect a "CA certificate
path".

NB: This package provides certificates, but does not configure them as
trust anchors in any particular SSL/TLS implementation.  See also
Mozilla-rootcerts-openssl for a package that configures these
certificates as trust anchors in OpenSSL.
