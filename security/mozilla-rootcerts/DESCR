This package provides the certificates distributed by the Mozilla
Project.  It also provides a script, mozilla-rootcerts, which can be
used to extract the root CA certificates distributed by the Mozilla
Project into the current working directory and to rehash the existing
certificates.  The directory can be used by most SSL-aware programs
that expect a "CA certificate path".

NB: This package provides certificates, but does not as a consequence
of installation configure them as trust anchors in any particular
SSL/TLS implementation.  See the mozilla-rootcerts script for a way to
configure them.  See also Mozilla-rootcerts-openssl for a package that
configures these certificates as trust anchors in OpenSSL.
