This package provides the certificates distributed by the Mozilla
Project.

It also provides a script, mozilla-rootcerts, which can be used to
install the root CA certificates distributed by the Mozilla Project
into a location that makes them usable by TLS implementations, extract
them to the current working directory, or rehash the existing
certificates.

NB: This package provides certificates, but does not as a consequence
of installation place them in a location that makes them immediately
usable by SSL/TLS implementations.

Use the 'mozilla-rootcerts install' script or mozilla-rootcerts-openssl
package if you want to use these certificates.
