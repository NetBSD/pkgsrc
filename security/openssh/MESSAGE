If "starter" configuration files were installed (in ${SSH_CONF_DIR})
when the package was installed, be sure to examine them (and the man pages
for ssh and sshd) to determine whether you want to make any changes.

Copies of the example configuration files are installed in
${PREFIX}/share/examples/openssh, so those can still be used for reference
after you have made changes to those installed in ${SSH_CONF_DIR}, or if
you had existing configuration files, which would not be overwritten in
the installation process.

In general, you will want to set up /etc/rc.local to start sshd at boot
time.  Something like the following should do the job:

# Run sshd if installed and configured
${PREFIX}/etc/rc.d/sshd
