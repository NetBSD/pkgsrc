racoon speaks IKE (ISAKMP/Oakley) key management protocol, to
establish IPsec security association with other hosts.

This is based on KAME racoon, with some enhancements such as
NAT-Traversal (needs kernel support), hybrid authentication, 
ISAKMP mode config, RADIUS support, IKE fragmentation and others.

Ipsec-tools' racoon is able to act as a VPN server for the
Cisco VPN client using hybrid authentication.
