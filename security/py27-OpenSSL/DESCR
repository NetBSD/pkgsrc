pyOpenSSL is a Python module that is a rather thin wrapper around (a
subset of) the OpenSSL library.  A lot of the object methods do
nothing more than call a corresponding function in the OpenSSL
library.

This legacy version is the last version supporting non-Rust
platforms (as well as, coincidentally, Python 2.7).
