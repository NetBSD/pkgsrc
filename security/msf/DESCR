The Metasploit Framework is an advanced open-source platform for developing, 
testing, and using exploit code. This release includes 18 exploits and 27 
payloads; many of these exploits are either the only ones publicly available 
or just much more reliable than anything else out there. The Framework will 
run on any modern system that has a working Perl interpreter, the Windows 
installer includes a slimmed-down version of the Cygwin environment.
