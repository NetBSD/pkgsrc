This package provides the certificates distributed by the Mozilla
Project and will, by default, install certificates trusted by the
Mozilla Project in the system OpenSSL certificate store.  Modification
of system configuration files is very irregular as pkgsrc should not
write anything outside of ${PREFIX}.

The sysadmin can configure the list of trusted certificates and also
add local certificates as needed by editing ca-certificates.conf and
re-running update-ca-certificates.

See also the mozilla-rootcerts and mozilla-rootcerts-openssl packages
for an alternative approach.
