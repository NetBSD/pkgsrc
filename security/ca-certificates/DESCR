This package provides the root certificates distributed by the Mozilla
Project as curated by Debian in their package of the same name, along
with tools to manage the set of configured trust anchors for openssl.

\todo Explain if Debian adds or removes, or if this is exactly the
same set.

NB: Installing this package will modify the configuration of the
openssl implementation used by pkgsrc, which is either the base system
openssl or pkgsrc openssl.  The modification is configuring every
certificate as a trust anchor.  Modification of system configuration
files is very irregular as pkgsrc should not write anything outside of
${PREFIX}.

The sysadmin can exclude CA certificates from the list of trust
anchors and also add local certificates as configured trust anchors by
editing ca-certificates.conf and re-running update-ca-certificates.

See also the mozilla-rootcerts and mozilla-rootcerts-openssl packages
for an alternative approach.
