This package contains the update-ca-certificates(8) tool maintained by
the Debian Project (in the ca-certificates package they distribute) to
manage the set of configured trust anchors for openssl.

The ca-certificates framework enables the sysadmin to configure the
certificates to install, using multiple sources of CA certificates, for
example to include local CAs. See update-ca-certificates(8) for details.

This package also contains the certificate authorities shipped with
Mozilla's browser to allow SSL-based applications to check for the
authenticity of SSL connections.

Please note that Debian, NetBSD, and pkgsrc can neither confirm nor deny
whether the certificate authorities whose certificates are included in
this package have in any way been audited for trustworthiness or RFC
3647 compliance.  Full responsibility to assess them belongs to the
local system administrator.

See also the mozilla-rootcerts and mozilla-rootcerts-openssl packages
for alternative approaches to installing CA certificates.
