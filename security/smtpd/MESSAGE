The necessary spool and configuration directories were created
under /var/spool/smtpd. Please edit /var/spool/smtpd/etc/smtp_check_rules
according to your taste.

You will want to start smtpfwdd in rc.local, and add a line like

smtp	stream	tcp	nowait	root	${PREFIX}/sbin/smtpd	smtpd

to your /etc/inetd.conf when you are done.
