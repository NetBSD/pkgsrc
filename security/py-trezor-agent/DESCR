This project allows you to use various hardware security devices to operate
GPG, SSH and age. Instead of keeping your key on your computer and decrypting
it with a passphrase when you want to use it, the key is generated and stored
on the device and never reaches your computer. Read more about the design here.

You can do things like sign your emails, git commits, and software packages,
manage your passwords (with pass and passage, among others), authenticate web
tunnels and file transfers, and more.
