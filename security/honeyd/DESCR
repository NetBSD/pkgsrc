Honeyd is a small daemon that creates virtual hosts on a network. The hosts 
can be configured to run arbitrary services, and their personality can be 
adapted so that they appear to be running certain operating systems. Honeyd 
enables a single host to claim multiple addresses - I have tested up to 
65536 - on a LAN for network simulation. Honeyd improves cyber security by 
providing mechanisms for threat detection and assessment. It also deters 
adversaries by hiding real systems in the middle of virtual systems.
