Perl doesn't really support "> /dev/null", so just capture into $output.

% ktruss -i perl -e 'qx(does-not-exist >/dev/null 2>&1);'|egrep 'dup2.*2'
does-not-exist: not found
% ktruss -i perl -e 'qx(does-not-exist 2>&1);'|egrep 'dup2.*2'           
 16954      1 perl     dup2(0x1, 0x2)              = 2

The problem is that, whilst Perl supports 2>&1 internally (and does not use
the shell at all) if there is no other redirection, it does not support file
redirection - it defers that (and therefore necessarily must also defer the
stderr redirection) to the shell.  If the system's shell happens to report
"Not found" errors before redirection is processed (E.g. NetBSD shell) then
the stderr redirection is happening too late to be captured.

That leads to unintended errors reported on stderr - primarily if sudo is not
installed on the system, or not in the $PATH.

Use the -m parameter to su, as ZM_WEB_USER shouldn't require a login shell.
