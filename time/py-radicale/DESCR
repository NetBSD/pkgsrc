The Radicale Project is a CalDAV (calendar) and CardDAV (contact)
server. It aims to be a light solution, easy to use, easy to install,
easy to configure. As a consequence, it requires few software
dependances and is pre-configured to work out-of-the-box.

The Radicale Project runs on most of the UNIX-like platforms (Linux,
BSD, MacOS X) and Windows. It is known to work with Evolution,
Lightning, iPhone and Android clients.
