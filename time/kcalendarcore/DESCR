This library provides access to and handling of calendar data.
It supports the standard formats iCalendar and vCalendar and the
group scheduling standard iTIP.

A calendar contains information like incidences (events, to-dos, journals),
alarms, time zones, and other useful information.  This API provides
access to that calendar information via well known calendar formats
iCalendar (or iCal) and the older vCalendar.
