TZInfo provides daylight savings aware transformations between times in
different timezones.

Data Sources
------------

TZInfo requires a source of timezone data.  There are two built-in options:

1. The TZInfo::Data library (the tzinfo-data gem).  TZInfo::Data contains a
   set of Ruby modules that are generated from the [IANA Time Zone
   Database](http://www.iana.org/time-zones).

2. A zoneinfo directory.  Most Unix-like systems include a zoneinfo
   directory containing timezone definitions. These are also generated from
   the [IANA Time Zone Database](http://www.iana.org/time-zones).

By default, TZInfo::Data will be used.  If TZInfo::Data is not available
(i.e.  if "require 'tzinfo/data'" fails), then TZInfo will search for a
zoneinfo directory instead (using the search path specified by
TZInfo::ZoneinfoDataSource::DEFAULT_SEARCH_PATH).

If no data source can be found, a TZInfo::DataSourceNotFound exception will
be raised when TZInfo is used.  Further information is available [in the
wiki](http://tzinfo.github.io/datasourcenotfound) to help with resolving
TZInfo::DataSourceNotFound errors.

The default data source selection can be overridden using
TZInfo::DataSource.set.

Custom data sources can also be used. See TZInfo::DataSource.set for further
details.
