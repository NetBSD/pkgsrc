Hitimes is a fast, high resolution timer library for recording
performance metrics.  It uses the appropriate low method calls for each
system to get the highest granularity time increments possible.

It currently supports any of the following systems:

* any system with the POSIX call `clock_gettime()`
* Mac OS X
* Windows
* JRuby

Using Hitimes can be faster than using a series of `Time.new` calls, and
it will have a much higher granularity. It is definitely faster than
using `Process.times`.
