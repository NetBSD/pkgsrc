A header-only C++ library is provided with support for dates, time
zones, ISO weeks, Julian dates, and Islamic dates. 'date' offers
extensive date and time functionality for the C++11, C++14 and C++17
standards and was written by Howard Hinnant and released under the MIT
license. A slightly modified version has been accepted (along with
'tz.h') as part of C++20. This package regroups all header files from
the upstream repository by Howard Hinnant so that other R packages can
use them in their C++ code. At present, few of the types have explicit
'Rcpp' wrappers though these may be added as needed.
