#   This is where you can configure which connections are allowed     #
#   and denied access onto your server. The password is optional.     #
#   You may have as many of these as you require. To allow/deny all   #
#   connections, use a '*' or 0.0.0.0/0.                              #
#                                                                     #
#  -- It is important to note that connect tags are read from the  -- #
#     TOP DOWN. This means that you should have more specific deny    #
#    and allow tags at the top, progressively more general, followed  #
#        by a <connect allow="*" (should you wish to have one).       #
#                                                                     #
# Connect blocks are searched twice for each user - once when the TCP #
# connection is accepted, and once when the user completes their      #
# registration. Most of the information (hostname, ident response,    #
# password, SSL when using STARTTLS, etc) is only available during    #
# the second search, so if you are trying to make a closed server,    #
# you will probably need a connect block just for user registration.  #

# Logging
# -------
#
# Logging is covered with the <log> tag, which you may use to change
# the behaviour of the logging of the IRCd.
#
# In InspIRCd as of 1.2, logging is pluggable and very extensible.
# Different files can log the same thing, different 'types' of log can
# go to different places, and modules can even extend the log tag
# to do what they want.
#
# An example log tag would be:
#  <log method="file" type="OPER" level="default" target="logs/opers.log">
# which would log all information on /oper (failed and successful) to
# a file called opers.log.
#
# There are many different types which may be used, and modules may
# generate their own. A list of useful types:
#  - USERS - information relating to user connection and disconnection
#  - OPER - succesful and failed oper attempts
#  - KILL - kill related messages
#  - snomask - server notices (*all* snomasks will be logged)
#  - FILTER - messages related to filter matches (m_filter)
#  - CONFIG - configuration related messages
#  - COMMAND - die and restart messages, and messages related to unknown user types
#  - SOCKET - socket engine informational/error messages
#  - MODULE - module related messages
#  - STARTUP - messages related to starting up the server
#
# You may also log *everything* by using a type of *, and subtract things out
# of that by using -TYPE - for example "* -USERINPUT -USEROUTPUT".
#
# Useful levels are:
#  - default (general messages, including errors)
#  - sparse (misc error messages)
#  - debug (debug messages)
#
# Some types only produce output in the debug level, those are:
#  - BANCACHE - ban cache debug messages
#  - CHANNELS - information relating to joining/creating channels
#  - CULLLIST - debug messages related to issues with removing users
#  - RESOLVER - DNS related debug messages
#  - CONNECTCLASS - Connection class debug messages
#  - USERINPUT
#  - USEROUTPUT
#
# The following log tag is highly default and uncustomised. It is recommended you
# sort out your own log tags. This is just here so you get some output.

<log method="file" type="* -USERINPUT -USEROUTPUT" level="default" target="logs/ircd.log">
