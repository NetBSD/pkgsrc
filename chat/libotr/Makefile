# There's an apparent bug in gcc 4.1.3 on i386 (as shipped in
# netbsd-5).  With -O2 and the stack protector (SSP) feature, the
# function otrl_auth_handle_revealsig is badly miscompiled.

#Not apparently relevant, but makes -S output easier to follow.
#CFLAGS+=		-ggdb
#A way to avoid the bug.
#CFLAGS+=		-O1

# Avoid optimization/SSP bug.
CONFIGURE_ARGS+=	--disable-gcc-hardening

# This seems irrelevant, but was on the list to check, and thus is
# left as a hint to others.
