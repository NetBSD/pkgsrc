Jitsi Videobridge is an XMPP server component that allows for multiuser video
communication. Unlike the expensive dedicated hardware videobridges, Jitsi
Videobridge does not mix the video channels into a composite video stream, but
only relays the received video channels to all call participants. Therefore,
while it does need to run on a server with good network bandwidth, CPU
horsepower is not that critical for performance.
