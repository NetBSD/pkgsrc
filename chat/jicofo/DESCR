JItsi COnference FOcus is a server side focus component used in Jitsi Meet
conferences.

Conference focus is mandatory component of Jitsi Meet conferencing system next
to the videobridge. It is responsible for managing media sessions between each
of the participants and the videobridge. Whenever new conference is about to
start an IQ is sent to the component to allocate new focus instance. After that
special focus participant joins Multi User Chat room. It will be creating
Jingle session between Jitsi videobridge and the participant. Although the
session in terms of XMPP is between focus user and participant the media will
flow between participant and the videobridge. That's because focus user will
allocate Colibri channels on the bridge and use them as its own Jingle
transport.
