Goofey is a program which provides many services by communicating
with a central server Pluto. Services provided by goofey include
remote user location, message sending, fortune provision, jargon
file lookup and a timetable service.

Goofey is the preferred mode of communciation of many people, as
it combines the immediacy of talk(1) and the asyncronous nature of
mail(1). That is, you will know if messages sent with goofey have
been received by the recipient almost immediately. Goofey also
provides facilies for users to supply finger type information, an
'away' message for when you are away, a 'quiet' message for when
you are busy or away from the terminal, in fact just about everything
that people have been put up a good case for being included in the
server.
