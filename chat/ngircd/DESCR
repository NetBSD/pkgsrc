ngIRCd is a free, portable and lightweight Internet Relay Chat
server for small or private networks, developed under the GNU
General Public License (GPL). It is easy to configure, can cope
with dynamic IP addresses, and supports IPv6, SSL-protected
connections as well as PAM for authentication. It is written from
scratch and not based on the original IRCd.
