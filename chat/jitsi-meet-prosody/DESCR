Jitsi Meet is an open-source (Apache) WebRTC JavaScript application that uses
Jitsi Videobridge to provide high quality, secure and scalable video
conferences. Jitsi Meet in action can be seen at here at the session #482 of
the VoIP Users Conference.

The Jitsi Meet client runs in your browser, without installing anything else on
your computer. You can try it out at https://meet.jit.si.

Jitsi Meet allows very efficient collaboration. Users can stream their desktop
or only some windows. It also supports shared document editing with Etherpad.

This package contains additional modules for Prosody.
