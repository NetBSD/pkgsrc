Atheme is a set of services for IRC networks designed for large IRC networks
with high scalability requirements. It is relatively mature software, with
some code and design derived from another package called Shrike.

Atheme's behavior is tunable using modules and a highly detailed configuration
file. Almost all behavior can be changed at deployment time just by editing
the configuration.
