Text mode menu- and window-driven IM interface that supports the
ICQ2000, Yahoo!, AIM, IRC, MSN, Gadu-Gadu and Jabber protocols. It
allows you to send, receive, and forward messages, URLs, SMSes
(both through the ICQ server and e-mail gateways supported by
Mirabilis), contacts, and email express messages. It also lets you
set your own and fetch others' away messages, and define external
handlers for incoming events. Apart from IM it supports LiveJournal
management and receiving RSS feeds.  This is a fork of CenterICQ.
