libgadu is library for handling Gadu-Gadu instant messenger protocol. For a
long time it was an intergral part of ekg application but due to packaging
issues and use in other appliactions it became a project on its own.
Proprietary protocol was reverse engineered which may make libgadu less than
100% compatible with the original.
