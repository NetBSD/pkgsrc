bitlbee is an IRC gateway to other chat networks.  It provides an IRC server
where users connect to and have access to all their contacts in XMPP, Twitter,
or even IRC itself.  External plugins are also available for Steam, Facebook,
Discord, etc.  Multiple users are supported too, where each one has its own
set of accounts and contacts.
