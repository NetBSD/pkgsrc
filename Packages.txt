 0 Intro
 ========

There is a lot of software freely available for Unix based systems, which
usually runs on NetBSD, too, sometimes with some modifications. The NetBSD
packages collection incorporates any such changes necessary to make that
software run on NetBSD, and makes the installation (and reinstallation) of
the software package easy by means of a single command.

The NetBSD package system is used to enable such freely available
third-party software to be built easily on NetBSD hosts. Once the software
has been built, it is manipulated with the pkg_* tools so that installation
and de-installation, printing of an inventory of all installed packages and
retrieval of one-line comments or more verbose descriptions are all simple.

Both the NetBSD packages collection and the NetBSD package system are
derived from FreeBSD.


 0.1 Overview
 =============

This document is divided into two parts.  The first, "User's Guide",
describes how one can use one of the packages in the Package
Collection, either by installing a precompiled binary package, or by
building your own copy using the NetBSD package system.  The second
part, "Package Constructor's Guide", explains how to prepare a package so
it can be easily built by other NetBSD users without knowing about the
package's building details.


 0.2 Terminology
 ===============

There has been a lot of talk about "ports", "packages", etc. so far. Here
is a description of all the terminology used within this document:

 * Package:
   A set of files and building instructions that describe what's necessary
   to build a certain piece of software using the NetBSD package
   system. Packages are traditionally stored under /usr/pkgsrc.

 * The NetBSD package system:
   This is the part of the NetBSD operating system handling building
   (compiling), installing and removing of packages.

 * Distfile:
   This term describes the file or files that are provided by the author
   of the piece of freely available software to distribute his work. All
   the changes necessary to build on NetBSD are reflected in the
   corresponding package. Usually the distfile is in the form of a
   compressed tar-archive, but other types are possible, too. Distfiles
   are stored below /usr/pkgsrc/distfiles.

 * Port:
   This is the term used by FreeBSD people for what we call a package.
   In NetBSD terminology, "port" refers to a different architecture.

 * Precompiled (binary) package:
   A set of binaries built by the NetBSD package system from a distfile
   using the NetBSD package system and stuffed together in a single .tgz
   file so it can be installed on machines of the same machine architecture
   without the need to recompile. Packages are generated in
   /usr/pkgsrc/packages by the NetBSD package system; there is also an
   archive on ftp.netbsd.org.

   Sometimes, this is referred to by the term "package" too,
   especially in the context of precompiled packages.

 * Program:
   The piece of software to be installed which will be constructed from
   all the files in the Distfile by the actions defined in the
   corresponding package. 

 * RCS IDs:
   Some files in a package contain RCS IDs to reflect which version of
   that file this is (inserted automatically by cvs). These IDs are used
   in several examples within this document, but as this document itself
   is managed by CVS, it can't list the RCS IDs in plaintext. Instead, the
   $s are written as <$>, resulting in <$>NetBSD<$> and <$>Id<$>.


====================
Part I: User's Guide
====================

 1 Installing a precompiled binary package
 =========================================

This section describes how to find, retrieve and install a precompiled
binary package that someone else already prepared for your type of machine.


 1.1 Where to get
 ================

Precompiled packages are stored on ftp.netbsd.org and its mirrors in the
directory /pub/NetBSD/packages for anon FTP access. Please pick the right
subdirectory there as indicated by "sysctl hw.machine_arch". In that
directory, there is a subdirectory for each category plus a subdirectory
"All" which includes the actual binaries in .tgz-files. The category
subdirectories use symbolic links to those files. (This is the same
directory layout as in /usr/pkgsrc/packages).

This same directory layout applies for CDROM distributions, only that the
directory may be rooted somewhere else, probably somewhere below /cdrom.
Please consult your CDROM's documentation for the exact location!


 1.2 How to do
 =============

If you have the files on a CDROM or downloaded them to your hard disk, you
can install them with the following command (be sure to su to root first):

	pkg_add /path/to/package.tgz

If you have FTP access and you don't want to download the packages via FTP
prior to installation, you can do this automatically by giving pkg_add an
ftp-URL:

	pkg_add ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/packages/`sysctl -n hw.machine_arch`/All/package.tgz

Please note that sysctl is used here to automatically determine the right
set of binary files. Also note that any packages needed to run the package
in question will be installed, too, assuming they are present where you
install from.

After you've installed packages, be sure to have /usr/pkg in your $PATH so
you can actually start the just installed program.


 1.3 A word of warning
 =====================

Please pay very careful attention to the warnings expressed in that manual
page about the inherent dangers of installing binary packages which you did
not create yourself, and the security holes that can be introduced onto
your system by indiscriminate adding of such files.


 2 Installing by Building
 ========================

This assumes that the package is already part of the NetBSD package system.
If it is not, then you are advised to read part II of this document,
"Package Constructor's Guide".


 2.1 Where to get pkgsrc
 =======================

To get the package source going, you need to get the pkgsrc.tar.gz file
from ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD-current/tar_files/pkgsrc.tar.gz and
unpack it into /usr/pkgsrc.

As an alternative, you can get pkgsrc via the Software Update Protocol,
SUP. To do so, make sure your supfile has a line saying "release=pkgsrc" in
it, see the examples in /usr/share/examples/supfiles, and that the
directory /usr/pkgsrc does exist. Then, simply start "sup -v
/path/to/your/supfile".


 2.2 Fetching distfiles
 ======================

There is one gotcha: The distribution file (i.e. the unmodified source)
must exist on your system for the packages system to be able to build it.
If it's not, then ftp(1) is used to fetch the distribution files
automatically.

You can overwrite some of the major distribution sites to fit to sites
that are close to your own. Have a look at /usr/pkgsrc/mk/mk.conf.example
to find some examples. This may save some of your bandwith and time.

If you don't have a permanent Internet connection and you want to know
which files to download, "make fetch-list" will tell you what you'll need.
Put these distfiles into /usr/pkgsrc/distfiles.


 2.3 How to build and install
 ============================

Assuming that has been done, become root and change into the relevant
directory. Then you can type

	make

at the shell prompt to build the various components of the package, and

	make install

at the shell prompt to install the various components into the correct
places on your system.

Taking the top system utility as an example, we can install it on our
system by building as shown in A.1.

The program is installed under the default root of the packages tree -
/usr/pkg. Should this not conform to your tastes, simply set the LOCALBASE
variable in your environment, and it will use that value as the root of
your packages tree. So, to use /usr/local, set

	LOCALBASE=/usr/local

in your environment.  There is, of course, one exception to this - X11
packages are traditionally installed in the X11 tree.  The environment
variable which governs an X11 package's location is X11BASE.  So to
install an X11 package into /usr/local/X11R6, set

	X11BASE=/usr/local/X11R6

in your environment.

However, beware that strange things may happen if you install X11
packages outside the X11 tree, in that libraries and header files may
not be found by other software, and Application Defaults may not be
found.  For that reason, you are advised to leave X11 packages in the
X11 tree.  We are looking at ways to change this. 

Some packages look in /etc/mk.conf to alter some configuration options
at build time. Have a look at /usr/pkgsrc/mk/mk.conf.example to get an
overview of what you can set there.


 3 Making a precompiled package
 ==============================

Once you have built and installed the package as mentioned above, you can
build it into a "binary package" - you might want to do this so that you
can use the binaries you have just built on another NetBSD system, or to
provide a simple means for others to use your binary package instead of
wasting CPU time - this is done by changing to the appropriate directory in
the pkgsrc tree, and typing the command

	make package

at the shell prompt. This will build and install your package (if not
already done), and then construct a binary package out of the results so
that you can use the pkg_* tools to manipulate this. The binary package is
stored under /usr/pkgsrc/packages, it's in the form of a gzipped file at
the present time. See appendix A.2 for a continuation of the above top
example.

Please see the "submitting" section later in this document on how to submit
such a binary package.


====================================
Part II: Package Constructor's Guide
====================================

 4 Package components - files, directories and contents
 ======================================================

Whenever you're preparing a package from the FreeBSD ports collection or
doing it from scratch, there is a number of files involved which are
described in the following sections. Special directions are given for what
differs from FreeBSD ports for each file.


 4.1 Makefile
 ============

Building, installation and creation of a binary package are all controlled
by the package's Makefile.

There is a Makefile for each package. This file includes the standard
bsd.pkg.mk file (referenced as "../../mk/bsd.pkg.mk"), which sets all the
definitions and actions necessary for the package to compile and install
itself. The mandatory fields are the DISTNAME which specifies the base name
of the distribution file to be downloaded from the site on the Internet,
MASTER_SITES which specifies that site, CATEGORIES which denotes the
categories into which the package falls, PKGNAME which is the name of the
package and the MAINTAINER name. This is so that anyone who quibbles with
the (always completely correct) decisions taken by the guy who maintains
the port can complain vigorously.

The MASTER_SITES may be set to one of the predefined sites:

	${MASTER_SITE_XCONTRIB}
	${MASTER_SITE_GNU}
	${MASTER_SITE_PERL_CPAN}
	${MASTER_SITE_TEX_CTAN}
	${MASTER_SITE_SUNSITE}

If one of these predefined sites is chosen, you may require the ability to
specify a subdirectory of that site.  Since these macros may expand to
more than one actual site, you MUST use the following construct to specify
a subdirectory:

	${MASTER_SITE_GNU:=subdirectory/name/}

(Note the trailing slash after the subdirectory name.) Use of the deprecated
MASTER_SITE_SUBDIR will not work.

Currently the following values are available for CATEGORIES. If more than
one is used, they need to be separated by spaces:

	archivers   corba      games     meta-pkgs  security
	audio       cross      graphics  misc       shells
	benchmarks  databases  lang      net        sysutils
	cad         devel      mail      news       textproc
	comms       editors    math      plan9      www
	converters  emulators  mbone     print      x11

See the NetBSD packages(7) manual page for a description of all available
options and variables.

Please pay attention to the following gotchas, especially when preparing a
package from the FreeBSD ports collection:

 - Remove all MANx and CATx definitions from the package Makefile -
   NetBSD has implemented automatic manual page handling, and these
   definitions are now obsolete.
 - Add MANCOMPRESSED (if not already there) if manpages are installed in
   compressed form by the package; see comment in bsd.pkg.mk
 - Replace /usr/local by ${PREFIX} in all files  (see patches below)
 - Delete any ldconfig commands - this will be done automatically for you
   if the NetBSD platform supports ldconfig, and other measures will be
   taken on platforms which do not support ldconfig (e.g. NetBSD/Alpha)
 - If modifying a package from the FreeBSD ports collection, preserve
   their RCS ID: remove the '$'s around the FreeBSD RCS Id, and insert the
   word FreeBSD, then add a <$>NetBSD<$> (Without the <>s, please remember
   the Terminology section), i.e.:

   before:
	# <$>Id: Makefile,v 1.17 1997/06/16 06:39:51 max Exp <$>

   after:
	# <$>NetBSD<$>
	# FreeBSD Id: Makefile,v 1.17 1997/06/16 06:39:51 max Exp
 - If the package installs any info files, the main info directory file
   needs to be updated to reflect this fact. NetBSD now has an INFO_FILES
   definition, which is used to do this. For example, to install the
   indent.info entry into the info directory file, simply use the

	INFO_FILES=	indent.info

   definition in the package Makefile. If the package does this insertion
   for you, you should specify USE_GTEXINFO in the package Makefile, to
   ensure that the pre-requisite GNU texinfo package is installed on your
   system.
 - Adjust MAINTAINER to be either yourself, if you plan to maintain the
   package for future updates, or set it to the default MAINTAINER
   packages@netbsd.org, as it is unlikely that the FreeBSD people will
   care about NetBSD packages.
 - If there exists a home page for the software in question, please
   add the variable HOMEPAGE right after MAINTAINER. The value of this
   variable should be the URL for the home page.

 4.2 files/*
 ===========

Most important, this directory contains the (mandatory) md5 checksum of all
the distfiles needed for the package to compile. This file - files/md5 -
contains an md5 checksum of the distribution file(s) to ensure that the
distfile retrieved from the Internet has not been altered by a malign force
to introduce a security hole or was corrupted during transfer. The file
contains the md5 checksum of the original distribution file used to create
the NetBSD package, from which any patches were generated etc. It can be
generated by hand using the md5(1) command or by invoking "make makesum".

The files directory also includes a checksum file for all the official
patches for the package, found in the patches/ directory (see section
4.3). This checksum file is called patch-sum, and includes an MD5 checksum
of all lines in the patch file except the NetBSD RCS Id. This file is
generated using the "make makepatchsum" command.

Besides that, if you have any files that you wish to be placed in the
package prior to configuration or building, you could place these files
here and use a cp command in the pre-configure target to achieve this.
Alternatively, you could simply diff the file against /dev/null and use the
patch mechanism to manage the creation of this file.


 4.3 patches/*
 =============

This directory contains files that are used by the patch(1) command to
modify the sources as distributed in the distribution file into a form that
will compile and run perfectly on NetBSD. The files are applied
successively in alphabetic order (as returned by a shell "patches/patch-*"
glob expansion), so patch-aa is applied before patch-ab etc.

The patch-?? files should be in diff -u format. This is because (not only)
the FreeBSD ports tsar finds this format easier to read than context diffs,
and so you have more chance of getting your NetBSD package accepted as part
of the FreeBSD ports system if you format your diffs in a unified fashion.

Furthermore, do not put changes for more than one file into a single
patch-file, as this will make future modifications more difficult.

One important thing to mention is to pay attention that no RCS IDs get
stored in the patch files, as these will cause problems when later checked
into the NetBSD CVS tree. To avoid this, use the "-U 2" or -U 1" option to
diff.

When preparing a FreeBSD port for the NetBSD packages system, it's likely
that the FreeBSD port will work on NetBSD. However, check that the person
who ported the software to FreeBSD has not played fast and loose with the
__FreeBSD__ cpp definition without good cause - a simple way to do this is
to do

	grep -i freebsd patches/patch-??

in the package directory.

Besides taking care of any FreeBSDisms, be sure to provide patches to
replace any occurance of /usr/local in any "Makefile"s in the original
package with ${PREFIX}.

When you have finished a package, remember to generate the checksums
for the patch files by using the "make makepatchsum" command, see
section 4.2.


 4.4 pkg/*
 =========

This directory contains several files used to manage the creation of binary
packages. Files from this directory are used in the binary package itself,
and will thus be installed on other machines, so you should be aware that
there is a wider audience than you might think for your comments and
witticisms.

 4.4.1 Mandatory files
 =====================

 * pkg/COMMENT:
   A one-line description of the piece of software. There is no need to
   mention the package's name - this will automatically be added by the
   pkg_* tools when they are invoked.

 * pkg/DESCR:
   A multi-line description of the piece of software.  This should include
   any credits where they are due.  Please bear in mind that others do not
   share your sense of humour (or spelling idiosyncracies), and that others
   will read everything that you write here.

 * pkg/PLIST:
   This file governs the files that are installed on your system: all the
   binaries, manual pages, etc. There are other directives which may be
   entered in this file, to control the creation and deletion of
   directories, and the location of inserted files.

If you're updating a FreeBSD package to work for NetBSD, please pay special
attention to the following things in pkg/PLIST:

 - If there are any "@exec ldconfig ..." statements, or any "@unexec
   ldconfig ...", delete them. NetBSD works out automatically whether to
   call ldconfig, since some NetBSD architectures do not have ldconfig.
 - Add any missing @dirrm statements


 4.4.2 Optional files
 ====================

 * pkg/INSTALL:
   Shell script invoked twice during pkg_add. First time after package
   extraction and before files are moved in place, the second time after
   the files to install are moved in place. This can be used to do any
   custom procedures not possible with @exec commands in PLIST. See
   pkg_add(1) and pkg_create(1) for more information.

 * pkg/DEINSTALL:
   This script is executed before any files are removed.  It is this
   script's responsibility to clean up any additional messy details around
   the package's installation, since all pkg_delete knows how to do is
   delete the files created in the original distribution. See pkg_delete(1)
   and pkg_create(1) for more information.

 * pkg/REQ:
   Require-script that is invoked before installation and de-installation
   to ensure things like certain accounts being available, user/sysadmin
   agreeing with usage policy, etc.

 * pkg/MESSAGE
   Display this file after installation of the package.
   Useful for things like legal notices on almost-free software,
   etc.


 4.5 scripts/*
 =============

This directory contains any files that are necessary for configuration of
your software, etc. If a script with any of the following names is present,
it will be executed at the appropriate time during the build process:

  pre-fetch          post-fetch
  pre-extract        post-extract
  pre-patch          post-patch
  pre-configure      post-configure     configure
  pre-build          post-build
  pre-install        post-install
  pre-package        post-package

See section 7 for a description of the build process.


 4.6 work/*
 ==========

When you type "make" the distribution files are unpacked into this
directory.  It can be removed by typing

	make clean

at the shell prompt. Also, this directory is used to keep various
timestamp files. 


 4.7 importing the package into CVS
 ==================================

Newly created packages should be imported with a vendor tag of "TNF" and
a release tag of "pkgsrc-base", e.g::

	cvs import pkgsrc/<category>/frobnitz TNF pkgsrc-base

Packages derived from a FreeBSD port could be imported with a vendor tag
of "FREEBSD" and a release tag of "FreeBSD-current-YYYY-MM-DD" (YYYY-MM-DD
being the date when the snapshot of the port were taken form the FreeBSD
tree), and then doing the necessary modifications by normal CVS operations.
E.g:

	cvs import pkgsrc/<category>/mumbler FREEBSD FreeBSD-current-1998-04-01
	cvs rm patches/patch-a
	cvs add patches/patch-aa
	cvs ci

Please note all package updates/additions in doc/pkg-CHANGES! Its very important
to keep this file uptodate, cause it will be used from scripts to automatically
update some pages on www.netbsd.org.


 5 PLIST* issues
 ===============

This section addresses some special issues that one needs to take attention
of when dealing with the PLIST file (or files, see below!).


 5.1 Miscellaneous
 =================

 * RCS Id:
   Be sure to add a RCS ID line as the first thing in any PLIST file your
   write:

	@comment <$>NetBSD<$>

 * ranlib:
   Don't put any ranlib commands into your PLIST files, as they will cause
   troubles when the package is removed. Just make sure the build-process
   does run ranlib - it usually does - and you can leave this out. This is
   usually only a problem when using ports from FreeBSD.

 * ldconfig:
   Don't put any ldconfig commands into your PLIST files, as they will
   cause problems.  All shared object caching is done automatically in
   NetBSD (this takes place when you see the "Automatic shared object
   handling" message), and so you can leave this out.  If any shared
   objects are found in the package, they will be dealt with
   automatically, running ldconfig on platforms which need it, and not
   otherwise.  This is usually only a problem when using ports from
   FreeBSD.

 * ${MACHINE_ARCH}, ${MACHINE_GNU_ARCH}:
   Some packages like emacs and perl embed information about which
   architecture they were built on into the pathnames where they install
   their file. To handle this case, PLIST will be preprocessed before
   actually used, and the symbol "${MACHINE_ARCH}" will be replaced by
   what "sysctl -n hw.machine_arch" gives. The same is done if the string
   ${MACHINE_GNU_ARCH} is embedded in PLIST somewhere - use this on
   packages that use GNU autoconfigure.

   Legacy note: There used to be a symbol "<$ARCH>" that was replaced by
   the output of "uname -m", but that's no longer supported and has been
   removed.

 * ${OPSYS}, ${OS_VERSION}:
   Some packages want to embed the OS name and version into some paths.
   to do this, use these two variables in PLIST. ${OPSYS} will be replaced
   by output from "uname -s", ${OS_VERSION} will be set to what "uname -r"
   gives.

 * Manpage-compression:
   Manpages should be installed in compressed form if MANZ is set (in
   bsd.own.mk), and uncompressed otherwise. To handle this in the PLIST
   file, the suffix ".gz" is appended/removed automatically for manpages
   according to MANZ and MANCOMPRESSED being set or not, see above for
   details. This modification of the PLIST file is done on a copy of it,
   not pkg/PLIST itself.


 5.2 MD/MI vs. general PLIST
 ===========================

Sometimes the packaging list in pkg/PLIST differs between platforms, e.g.
if one of them supports shared libs and the other does not. To address
this, a hook has been introduced into the NetBSD packages system to provide
a PLIST file defined on conditions set freely in the package's Makefile.


 5.2.1 $PLIST_SRC
 ================

To use one or more files as source for the PLIST used in generating the
binary package, set the variable PLIST_SRC to the names of that file(s).
The files are later concatenated using cat(1), and order of things is an
important issue, see below.


 5.2.2 PLIST-mi, PLIST-md.shared, PLIST-md.static
 ================================================

If PLIST_SRC is not set (the usual case), and if there is no pkg/PLIST, the
packages system looks for pkg/PLIST-mi, and pkg/PLIST-md.shared or
pkg/PLIST-md.static to handle differences due to the platform being able to
handle shared libs or not. PLIST-mi contains machine independent files,
PLIST-md.* contain machine dependent files, which may differ between
architectures that don't support dynamic libs/shared loading. Currently,
this is only used in the perl-packages, and as perl5 on alpha doesn't
support dynamic loading of extensions like perl/Tk yet, PLIST.mi-static is
also used on the alpha (besides pmax and powerpc). Alpha will hopefully be
removed soon when perl's fixed for dynamic loading.

(This handling of MI/MD PLIST files is implemented by setting PLIST_SRC to
either "PLIST-mi PLIST-md.static" or "PLIST-mi PLIST-md.shared", see
/usr/pkgsrc/mk/bsd.pkg.mk).


 5.2.3 Order in the PLIST* file(s)
 =================================

There is one gotcha regarding the ordering of @dirrm statements: any MI
@dirrm directives that follow any MD @dirrm's *must* go into the PLIST.md-*
files, as the files PLIST-mi and PLIST.md-{shared/static} are concatenated
in exactly this order. If the MI directory would be listed in PLIST-mi, it
would be removed before the MD directory, which wouldn't work.

E.g. if you have the following dirs:
        foo/mi
        foo/mi/md

then PLIST-mi contains:
        <nothing>

and PLIST-md.* contain:
        @dirrm foo/mi/md
        @dirrm foo/mi

This will lead to some @dirrm statements being duplicated, but it's the
only way to ensure everything is properly removed. The same care must be
taken when PLIST_SRC is set to some package-specific settings.
  

 6 Notes on fixes for packages
 =============================

 6.1 CPP defines
 ===============

To port an application to NetBSD, it's usually necessary for the compiler
to be able to judge the system on which it's compiling, and we use
definitions so that the C pre-processor can do this.

The really impatient should just note that a number of the FreeBSD ports
(which are called packages in the NetBSD world) rely on the CPP definition
__FreeBSD__. This should be used sparingly, for FreeBSD-specific features,
but unfortunately this is not always the case. A number also rely on the
fact that the CPU type is an Intel-based little-endian CPU.

To test whether you are working on a 4.4 BSD-derived system, you should use
the BSD definition, which is defined in <sys/param.h> on said systems.

        #include <sys/param.h>

and then you can surround the BSD-specific parts of your port using the
conditional:

	#if (defined(BSD) && BSD >= 199306)
	...
	#endif

Please use the __NetBSD__ definition sparingly - it should only apply to
features of NetBSD that are not present in other 4.4-lite derived BSDs.

You should also avoid defining __FreeBSD__=1 and then simply using the
FreeBSD port, if only from an aesthetic viewpoint.


 6.2 Shared libraries - libtool
 ==============================

NetBSD supports many different machines, with different object formats
like a.out and ELF, and varying abilities to do shared library and
dynamic loading at all. To accompany this, verying commands and options
have to be passed to the compiler, linker etc. to get the Right Thing,
which can be pretty annoying especially if you don't have all the
machines at your hand to test things.  The "libtool" pkg can help
here, as it just "knows" how to build both static and dynamic
libraries from a set our source files, thus being platform
independent. 

To use "libtool", add a build-dependency on the libtool-pkg, then modify
the pkg's sources to use libtool for building it's libraries and add the
resulting patches to your pkg's patches-directory. 

Here's how to use libtool in a pkg in seven simple steps:

1. Add USE_LIBTOOL= yes to the package Makefile.

2. For library objects, use "${LIBTOOL} --mode=compile ${CC}" in place of
   ${CC}.  You could even add it to the definition of CC, if only
   libraries are being built in a given Makefile.  This one command will
   build both PIC and non-PIC library objects, so you need not have
   separate shared and non-shared library rules.

3. For the linking of the library, remove any "ar", "ranlib", and "ld
   -Bshareable" commands, and use instead:

	${LIBTOOL} --mode=link cc -o ${.TARGET:.a=.la} ${OBJS:.o=.lo} -rpath ${PREFIX}/lib -version-info major:minor

   Note that the library is changed to have a .la extension, and the
   objects are changed to have a .lo extension.  Change OBJS as necessary.
   This automatically creates all of the .a, .so.major.minor, and ELF
   symlinks (if necessary) in the build directory.

4. When linking programs that depend on these libraries _before_ they are
   installed, preface the cc or ld line with "${LIBTOOL} --mode=link", and
   it will find the correct libraries (static or shared), but please be
   aware that libtool will not allow you to specify a relative path in -L
   (such as -L../somelib), because it is trying to force you to change
   that argument to be the .la file.  For example:

	${LIBTOOL} --mode=link ${CC} -o someprog -L../somelib -lsomelib

   won't work; it needs to be changed to:

	${LIBTOOL} --mode=link ${CC} -o someprog ../somelib/somelib.la

   and it will DTRT with the libraries.  If you *must* use a relative path 
   with -L, and you are not going to run this program before installing
   it, you can omit the use of libtool during link and install of this
   program if you add the subdirectory ".libs" in your -L command:

	${CC} -o someprog -L../somelib/.libs -lsomelib

5. When installing libraries, preface the install or cp command with
   "${LIBTOOL} --mode=install", and change the library name to .la.  For
   example:

	${LIBTOOL} --mode=install ${BSD_INSTALL_DATA} ${SOMELIB:.a=.la} ${PREFIX}/lib

   This will install the static .a, shared library, any needed symlinks,
   and run "ldconfig."

6. In your PLIST, include the .a, .la, and .so.major.minor files.  Don't
   include the ELF symlink files; those are automatic. 

FOR GNU PKGS THAT ALREADY SUPPORT LIBTOOL: 
Add USE_LIBTOOL=yes to the package Makefile.  You may possibly have to
modify the "configure" script not to check for or configure its own
libtool.  See the libwww pkg, patch-ab, for the quick way to bypass
the pkg's own libtool.


 6.3 Gotchas of FreeBSD ports
 ============================

See section 4.1 for Makefile issues (MANx, CATx, MANCOMPRESSED, ldconfig,
RCS IDs) and section 4.3 for gotchas on using patches from FreeBSD ports.

One of the biggest problems with FreeBSD ports is that too many of
them assume they will install into /usr/local, instead of honouring
any ${PREFX} setting properly.  To change this, add something like the
following into your package Makefile:

pre-configure:
        for f in `find ${WRKDIR} -type f -print|xargs grep -l '/usr/local'`; do
\
                ${SED} -e 's:/usr/local:'${PREFIX}':g' < $$f > $$f.pdone && ${MV} $
$f.pdone $$f; \
        done

This is taken from the sysutils/rtty package; be sure this works for your
package - it may actually make sense to look for some things in /usr/local,
for example. So don't blindly replace all occurrences of /usr/local!

FreeBSD has decided to list manual pages in the package Makefile, with
no corresponding entry in the PLIST.  You will thus need to add any
MAN[1-8ln] files to the PLIST, before deleting the MAN[1-8ln]
definition.  Similarly with MLINKS and CAT[1-8ln] entries.

Side note on manpages in PLIST:  we don't take any notice of any .gz
suffix there, as many FreeBSD ports seem to have .gz pages in PLIST
even when they install manpages without compressing them; rather, we
add our own .gz suffix there according to MANZ.  In short, it does not
matter whether the manual page name in the PLIST has a .gz suffix or
not - if it needs one which is not already there, it will be appended
automatically, and if there is a .gz suffix which is not needed, it
will be deleted automatically.

Some packages use bsd-style .mk files when building, and so any manual
pages that are installed will be gzip-compressed, if MANZ is set, or
not if MANZ is not set.  If the package uses bsd-style .mk files, the
variable MANCOMPRESSED_IF_MANZ should be set to a value of "yes" in
the package Makefile.


 6.4 Feedback to the author
 ==========================

If you have found any bugs in the package you make available, if you had to
do special steps to make it run under NetBSD or if you enhanced the
software in various other ways, be sure to report these changes back to the
original author of that program! Only with that kind of support, the next
release of the program can incorporate these fixes, and also people not
using the NetBSD packages system can win from your efforts.

Support the idea of free software!


 7 The build process
 ===================

The basic steps for building a program are always the same.  First the
program's source (distfile) must be brought to the local system and
then extracted.  After any patches to compile properly on NetBSD are
applied, the software can be configured, then built (usually by
compiling), and finally the generated binaries etc.  can be put into
place on the system.  These are exactly the steps performed by the
NetBSD package system, which is implemented as a series of targets in
a central Makefile, /usr/pkgsrc/mk/bsd.pkg.mk.


 7.1 Program location
 ====================

Before outlining the process performed by the NetBSD package system in the
next section, here's a brief discussion on where programs are installed,
and which variables influence this.

The automatic variable PREFIX indicates where all files of the final
program shall be installed.  It is usually set to $LOCALBASE (/usr/pkg),
or $CROSSBASE for pkgs in the "cross" category, though its value becomes
that of $X11BASE if USE_IMAKE, USE_MOTIF, or USE_X11BASE is set.  The value
${PREFIX} needs to be put into the various places in the program's source
where paths to these files are encoded; see sections 4.3 and 6.2 for
details on this.

When choosing which of these variables to use, follow the following rules:

 * ${PREFIX} always points to the location where the current pkg will be
   installed.  When referring to a pkg's own installation path, use ${PREFIX}.

 * ${LOCALBASE} is where all non-X11 pkgs are installed.  If you need to
   construct a -I or -L argument to the compiler to find includes and
   libraries installed by another non-X11 pkg, use ${LOCALBASE}.

 * ${X11BASE} is where the actual X11 distribution is installed.  When looking
   for _standard_ X11 includes (not those installed by a pkg), use ${X11BASE}.

 * X11 based pkgs are special in that they may be installed in either
   X11BASE or LOCALBASE depending on a configuration option in /etc/mk.conf.  
   If you need to find includes or libraries installed by a pkg that has
   USE_IMAKE, USE_MOTIF, or USE_X11BASE in its pkg Makefile, you need to use
   _both_ ${X11BASE} and ${LOCALBASE}.


 7.2 Main targets
 ================

The main targets used during the build process defined in bsd.pkg.mk are:

 * fetch:
   This will check if the file(s) given in the variables DISTFILES and
   PATCHFILES (as defined in the package's Makefile) are present on the
   local system in /usr/pkgsrc/distfiles. If they are not present, they
   will be fetched using ftp(1) from the site(s) given in the variable
   PATCH_SITES. The location(s) in PATCH_SITES are in the form of URLs
   and can be ftp://- and http://-URLs, as ftp(1) understands both of
   them.

 * checksum:
   After the distfile(s) are fetched, their MD5 checksum is generated and
   compared with the checksums stored in the files/md5 file. If the
   checksums don't match, the build is aborted. This is to ensure the same
   distfile is used for building, and that the distfile wasn't changed,
   e.g. by some malign force or network lossage. 

 * extract:
   When the distfiles are present on the local system, they need to be
   extracted, as they are usually in the form of some compressed archive
   format, most commonly .tar.gz. If only some of the distfiles need to be
   uncompressed, the files to be uncompressed should be put into
   EXTRACT_ONLY. If the distfiles are not in .tar.gz format, they can be
   extracted by setting EXTRACT_CMD, EXTRACT_BEFORE_ARGS and/or
   EXTRACT_AFTER_ARGS. 

 * patch:
   After extraction, all the patches named by the PATCHFILES and those
   present in the patches subdirectory of the package are applied. 
   Patchfiles ending in .Z or .gz are uncompressed before they are
   applied, files ending in .orig or .rej are ignored.  Any special
   options to patch(1) can be handed in PATCH_DIST_ARGS.  See section
   4.3 for more details.

 * configure:
   Most pieces of software need information on the header files,
   system calls, and library routines which are available in NetBSD. 
   This is the process known as configuration, and is usually
   automated.  In most cases, a script is supplied with the source,
   and its invokcation results in generation of header files,
   Makefiles, etc.

   If the program doesn't come with its own configure script, one can be
   placed in the package's scripts directory, called "configure". If so, it
   is executed using sh(1).

   If the program's distfile contains its own configure script, this can
   be invoked by setting HAS_CONFIGURE. If the configure script is a GNU
   autoconf script, GNU_CONFIGURE should be specified instead. In either
   case, any arguments to the configure script can be specified in the
   CONFIGURE_ARGS variable, and the configure script's name can be set in
   CONFIGURE_SCRIPT if it differs from the default "configure".

   If the program uses an Imakefile for configuration, the appropriate
   steps can be invoked by setting USE_IMAKE to YES. (If you only want the
   package installed in $X11BASE but xmkmf not being run, set USE_X11BASE
   instead!)

 * build:
   Once configuration has taken place, the software can be built on
   NetBSD by invoking $MAKE_PROGRAM on $MAKEFILE with $ALL_TARGET as
   the target to build.  The default MAKE_PROGRAM is "gmake" if
   USE_GMAKE is set, "make" otherwise.  MAKEFILE is set to "Makefile"
   by default, and ALL_TARGET defaults to "all".  Any of these
   variables can be set to change the default build process.

 * install:
   Once the build stage has completed, the final step is to install
   the software in public directories, for users.  As in the
   build-target, $MAKE_PROGRAM is invoked on $MAKEFILE here, but with
   the $INSTALL_TARGET instead, the latter defaulting to "install"
   (plus "install.man", if USE_IMAKE is set). 

If no target is specified, the default is "build". If a subsequent stage
is requested, all prior stages are made: e.g. "make build" will also
perform the equivalent of:

	make fetch
	make checksum
	make extract
	make patch
	make configure
	make build


 7.3 Other helpful targets
 =========================

 * pre/post-*
   For any of the main targets described in the previous section, two
   auxiliary targets exist with "pre-" and "post-" used as a prefix
   for the main target's name.  These targets are invoked before and
   after the main target is called, allowing extra configuration or
   installation steps, for example, which program's configure script
   or install target omitted.  For any of these auxiliary targets,
   scripts of the same name can be placed in the package's
   scripts-subdirectory that will be executed at the given time, see
   section 4.5.

 * do-*:
   Should one of the main targets do the wrong thing, and should there
   be no variable to fix this, you can redefine it with the do-*
   target.  (Note that redefining the target itself instead of the
   do-* target is a bad idea, as the pre-* and post-* targets won't be
   called anymore, etc.) You will not usually ned to do this.

 * reinstall:
   If you did a "make install" and you noticed some file was not installed
   properly, you can repeat the installation with this target, which will
   ignore the "already installed" flag. 

 * deinstall:
   This target does a pkg_delete(1) in the current directory,
   effectively de-installing the package. The following variables can
   be used either on the command line or in /etc/mk.conf to tune the
   behaviour: 

    - PKG_VERBOSE:
      Add a "-v" to the pkg_delete(1) command.
      
    - DEINSTALLDEPENDS:
      Remove all packages that require (depend on) the given package.
      This can be used to remove any packages that may have been pulled in
      by a given package, e.g. if "make deinstall DEINSTALLDEPENDS=1" is
      done in x11/kde, this is likely to remove whole KDE. Works by adding
      a "-R" to the pkg_delete command line.

 * update:
   This target causes the current package to be updated to the latest
   version.  The package and all depending packages first get deinstalled,
   then current versions of the corresponding packages get compiled and
   installed.  This is similar to manually noting which packages are
   currently installed, then performing a series of "make deinstall",
   "make clean", and "make install" for these packages.  The following
   variables can be used either on the command line or in /etc/mk.conf to
   alter the behaviour of "make update":

    - REINSTALL:
      Do not recreate the list of depending packages, and do not
      "make clean" for every package that gets updated.  This is
      useful if you want to resume the updating process after an
      error or pressing Control-C, e.g. through
      "make update REINSTALL=1".

    - DEPENDS_TARGET:
      Install target to use for the updated package and the
      dependent packages.  Defaults to "install".  E.g.
      "make update DEPENDS_TARGET=package"

 * readme:
   This target generates a README.html file, which can be viewed using a
   browser such as netscape (pkgsrc/www/mozilla) or lynx (pkgsrc/www/lynx).
   The generated files contain references to any packages which are in the
   ${PACKAGES} directory on the local host.  The generated files can
   be made to refer to URLs based on FTP_PKG_URL_HOST and
   FTP_PKG_URL_DIR.  (For example, if I wanted to generate README.html
   files which pointed to binary packages on the local machine, in the
   directory /usr/packages, set FTP_PKG_URL_HOST=file://localhost and
   FTP_PKG_URL_DIR=/usr/packages. The ${PACKAGES} directory and its
   subdirectories will be searched for all the binary packages.)

 * readme-all: 
   Use this target to create a file README-all.html which contains a
   list of all packages currently available in the NetBSD Packages
   Collection, together with the category they belong to and a short
   description. This file is compiled from the pkgsrc/*/README.html
   files, so be sure to run this _after_ a "make readme".

 * cdrom-readme:
   This is very much the same as the readme: target (see above), but is
   to be used when generating a pkgsrc tree to be written to a CD-ROM.
   This target also produces README.html files, and can be made to refer
   to URLs based on CDROM_PKG_URL_HOST and CDROM_PKG_URL_DIR.

 * show-distfiles:
   This target shows which distfiles and patchfiles are needed to build
   the package.

 * show-downlevel:
   This target shows nothing if the package is not installed. If a version
   of this package is installed, but is not the version provided in this
   version of pkgsrc, then a warning message is displayed. This target can
   be used to show which of your installed packages are downlevel, and so
   the old versions can be deleted, and the current ones added.



 8 Debugging
 ===========

To check out all the gotchas when building a package from a FreeBSD port,
here are the steps that I do in order to get a package working. Please note
this is basically the same as what was explained in the previous sections,
only with some debugging aids.

 - Retrieve port from FreeBSD collection
 - Fix RCS-ID in the package's Makefile, see section 4.1. 
 - Import unchanged FreeBSD source (ONLY if you have cvs access, not needed
   otherwise):
   (cd .../pkgsrc/category/pkgname ; cvs import pkgsrc/category/pkgname \
	FREEBSD FreeBSD-current-yyyy-mm-dd)
 - If you did a CVS import, check it out to apply the following fixes
   (not needed if you don't have CVS access!)
 - Look at Makefile, fix if necessary; see section 4.1. 
 - Look at patches, remember if not appropriate
 - Have a look at pkg/PLIST, add a "@comment <$>NetBSD<$>" line at the
   beginning of any PLIST file (see section 5). 
 - make
 - If something is not ok, fix; for patches: fix the file, then re-generate
   the diff: 'diff -bu foo.orig foo >../../patches/patch-xx' (mv patch-xx
   patch-xx.orig before); If there's no foo.orig from a previous patch, be
   sure to have an old version of the file somewhere; re-iterate :)
 - If all builds OK: touch /tmp/bla
 - make install
 - find /usr/pkg/ /usr/X11R6/ -newer /tmp/bla >/tmp/x
   (or whatever you set LOCALBASE and X11BASE to)
 - pkg_delete blub
 - find /usr/pkg/ /usr/X11R6/ -newer /tmp/bla: if this brings up any files,
   they are missing in pkg/PLIST*; add them.
 - Compare pkg/PLIST* against /tmp/x, fix the former one
   ( sort /tmp/x >/tmp/x2 ; sort pkg/PLIST >/tmp/P ; sdiff /tmp/x2 /tmp/P )
 - make reinstall && make package
 - pkg_delete blub
 - "find /usr/pkg/ /usr/X11R6/ -type f -newer /tmp/bla" shouldn't find anything
   now
 - pkg_add .../blub.tgz
 - Play with it :)
 - pkg_delete - still no file should be left (re-run above find)
 - submit (or commit, if you have cvs access); see section 10.


 9 FAQs & features of the package system
 =======================================

 9.1 Packages using GNU autoconfig
 =================================

If your package uses GNU autoconf, add the following to your package's
Makefile:

> GNU_CONFIGURE= yes

Note that this appends --prefix=${PREFIX} to CONFIGURE_ARGS, so you don't
have to do that yourself, and this may not be what you want.


 9.2 Other distrib methods than .tar.gz
 ======================================

If your package uses a different distribution method from .tar.gz, take a
look at the package for plan9/sam, which uses a gzipped shell archive
(shar), but the quick solution is to set EXTRACT_SUFX to the name after the
DISTNAME field, and add the following to your package's Makefile:

> EXTRACT_SUFX=   .msg.gz
> EXTRACT_CMD=            zcat
> EXTRACT_BEFORE_ARGS=
> EXTRACT_AFTER_ARGS=     |sh


 9.3 Packages not creating their own subdirectory
 ================================================

Your package doesn't create a subdirectory for itself (like GNU software
does, for instance), but extracts itself in the current directory: see
plan9/sam again, but the quick answer is:

> NO_WRKSUBDIR=   yes


 9.4 Custom configuration process
 ================================

Your package uses a weird Configure script: See the top package, but the
quick answer is:

> HAS_CONFIGURE=          yes
> CONFIGURE_SCRIPT=       Configure
> CONFIGURE_ARGS+=        netbsd13


 9.5 Packages not building in their DISTNAME directory
 ======================================================

Your package builds in a different directory from its base DISTNAME - see
tcl and tk packages:

> WRKSRC=         ${WRKDIR}/${DISTNAME}/unix


 9.6 How to fetch all distfiles at once
 ======================================

You would like to download all the distfiles in a single batch from work or
university, where you can't run a "make fetch". But there's no archive of
the distfiles on ftp.netbsd.org and the one on ftp.freebsd.org contains
many distfiles for which there are no ports (yet).

The answer here is to do a "make fetch-list" in /usr/pkgsrc and use the
resulting list.


 9.7 How to fetch files from behind a firewall
 =============================================

If you are sitting behind a firewall, you must specify the relevant proxy
hosts to enable you to talk to other machines on the Internet which are not
behind your firewall. This is an environment variable in the form of a URL
e.g. in Amdahl, the machine orpheus.amdahl.com is one of the firewalls, and
it uses port 80 as the proxy port number. So the proxy environment
variables look like:

	ftp_proxy=ftp://orpheus.amdahl.com:80/
	http_proxy=http://orpheus.amdahl.com:80/


 9.8 If your patch contains an RCS ID
 ====================================

See section 4.3 on how to remove RCS IDs from patch files. 


 9.9 How to pull in variables from /etc/mk.conf
 ==============================================

The problem with package-defined variables that can be overridden via
MAKECONF or /etc/mk.conf is that make(1) expands a variable as it is
used, but evaluates preprocessor like statements (.if, .ifdef and
.ifndef) as they are read.  So, to use any variable (which may be set
in /etc/mk.conf) in one of the .if* statements, the file /etc/mk.conf
must be included before that .if* statement.

Rather than have a number of ad-hoc ways of including /etc/mk.conf,
should it exist, or MAKECONF, should it exist, include the
pkgsrc/mk/bsd.prefs.mk file in the package Makefile before any
preprocessor-like .if, .ifdef, or .ifndef statements:

	.include "../../mk/bsd.prefs.mk"

	.if defined(USE_MENUS)
	...
	.endif


 9.10 Is there a mailing list for pkg-related discussion?
 ========================================================

Yes. We are using tech-pkg@netbsd.org for discussing package related
issues. To subscribe do:

    echo subscribe tech-pkg | mail majordomo@netbsd.org


 9.11 How do i tell "make fetch" to do passive FTP?
 ==================================================

Add the following to your /etc/mk.conf file: PASSIVE_FETCH=1


 9.12 Dependencies on other packages
 ===================================

Your package may depend on some other package being present - and
there are various ways of expressing this dependency.  NetBSD supports
the BUILD_DEPENDS, RUN_DEPENDS and DEPENDS definitions (beware:  the
DEPENDS definition is not the same as FreeBSD's deprecated one, and
NetBSD does not use the FreeBSD LIB_DEPENDS definition any more - it
proved problematic on ELF NetBSD platforms).

[In the following examples, the BUILD_DEPENDS and RUN_DEPENDS
dependencies have the format:  <file>:<directory containing package to
build>[:<stage>] If the <stage> isn't specified, it defaults to
``install''.  If the file contains a '/', it is interpreted as a
regular file - otherwise, the name is taken to be an executable file,
and the PATH is searched for <file>.  If the regular file is not
found, or the exectable file is not in the path, then the
pre-requisite package will be built from the sources in <directory
containing the package to build>.  The DEPENDS definition specifies a
package name (which contains its version number), and the directory
containing the package to build if this version of the package is not
installed.]

(a) If your package needs files from another package to build, see the
print/ghostscript5 package (it relies on the jpeg sources being
present in source form during the build):

BUILD_DEPENDS=  ../../graphics/jpeg/${WRKDIR:T}/jpeg-6a:../../graphics/jpeg:extract

(b) If your package needs to use another package to build itself, this
is specified using the BUILD_DEPENDS definition, but without
specifying the stage ``:extract'' in (a) above.  An example is the
print/lyx package, which uses the latex binary during its build
process:

BUILD_DEPENDS=  latex:../../print/teTeX

(c) If your package needs a library with which to link, this is
specified using the DEPENDS definition.  An example of this is the
print/lyx package, which uses the xpm library, version 3.4j to build.

DEPENDS+=       xpm-3.4j:../../graphics/xpm

You can also use wildcards in package dependences:

DEPENDS+=	xpm-*:../../graphics/xpm

Note that these wildcards will be expanded while creating binary packages.
Thus binary package will depend on exactly the version which was installed
when they were created.

(d) If your package needs some executable to be able to run correctly,
this is specified using the RUN_DEPENDS definition.  The print/lyx
package needs to be able to execute the latex and ispell binaries when
it runs, and that is specified:

RUN_DEPENDS=    latex:../../print/teTeX \
                ispell:../../textproc/ispell


 9.13 Conflicts with other packages
 ==================================

Your package may conflict with other packages a user might already have
installed on his system, e.g. if your package installs the same set of
files like another package in our pkgsrc tree.

In this case you can set CONFLICTS to a space seperated list of packages
(including version string) your package conflicts with.

For example pkgsrc/x11/Xaw3d and pkgsrc/x11/Xaw-Xpm install provide the
same shared library, thus you set in pkgsrc/x11/Xaw3d/Makefile:

CONFLICTS=      Xaw-Xpm-*

and in pkgsrc/x11/Xaw-Xpm/Makefile:

CONFLICTS=      Xaw3d-*

Packages will automatically conflict with other packages with the name prefix
and a different version string. "Xaw3d-1.5" e.g. will automatically conflict
with the older version "Xaw3d-1.3".

 9.14 Software which has a WWW Home Page
 =======================================

The NetBSD packages system now supports a variable called HOMEPAGE.
If the software being packaged has a home page, the Makefile should
include the URL for that page in the HOMEPAGE variable. The definition
of the variable should be placed immediately after the MAINTAINER
variable.


 10 Submitting
 =============

 * precompiled binary packages:
   Please contact us for directions on how to provide your precompiled
   binary packages.
   [XXX - need more info here - do we have a incoming-dir for such things
          on ftp.netbsd.org? - hubertf]

 * packages:
   First, check that your package is complete, compiles and runs well; see
   section 8 and the rest of this document. Then, generate a gzipped
   tar-file of all the files needed for the package, preferably with all
   files in a single directory. Place this tar-file to a place where the
   package maintainers can fetch it using FTP or HTTP (WWW). Finally,
   send-pr with category "pkg", a short description of your package
   (contents of pkg/COMMENT are OK), plus the URL of your tar-file.

   You will be notified if your send-pr has been addressed so you can remove
   the tar-file. 


 11 A simple example of a package: bison
 =======================================

I checked to find a piece of software that isn't in the FreeBSD ports
collection, and picked GNU bison. Quite why someone would want to have
bison when Berkeley yacc is already present in the tree is beyond me, but
it's useful for the purposes of this exercise.


 11.1 files
 ==========

The file contents in this section must be used without the "> " prefix.

 11.1.5 Checking a package "pkglint"
 ===================================

The NetBSD package system comes with a tool called "pkglint" (located in the
directory "pkgsrc/pkgtools/pkglint") which helps to check the contents of these
files. After installation it is quite easy to use, just change to the
directory of the package you which to examine and execute "pkglint":

> tron@lyssa:/usr/pkgsrc/devel/bison>pkglint
> OK: checking pkg/COMMENT.
> OK: checking pkg/DESCR.
> OK: checking Makefile.
> OK: checking files/md5.
> OK: checking patches/patch-aa.
> looks fine.

Depending on the supplied command line arguments (see "man pkglint") more
intensive checks will be performed. Use e.g. "pkglint -a -v" for a very
detailed and verbose check.


 11.2 Steps for building, installing, packaging
 ==============================================

Create the directory where the package lives, plus any auxiliary directories:

> root@pumpy:/u/pkgsrc/lang(1765)# cd /usr/pkgsrc/lang
> root@pumpy:/u/pkgsrc/lang(1765)# mkdir bison
> root@pumpy:/u/pkgsrc/lang(1766)# cd bison
> root@pumpy:/u/pkgsrc/lang/bison(1768)# mkdir files patches pkg

Create Makefile, pkg/COMMENT, pkg/DESCR and pkg/PLIST as in section 11.1,
then continue with fetching the distfile:

> root@pumpy:/u/pkgsrc/lang/bison(1769)# make fetch
> >> bison-1.25.tar.gz doesn't seem to exist on this system.
> >> Attempting to fetch from ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu//.
> Requesting ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu//bison-1.25.tar.gz (via ftp://orpheus.amdahl.com:80/)
> ftp: Error retrieving file: 500 Internal error
>  
> >> Attempting to fetch from ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu/systems/gnu//.
> Requesting ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu/systems/gnu//bison-1.25.tar.gz (via ftp://orpheus.amdahl.com:80/)
> ftp: Error retrieving file: 500 Internal error
>  
> >> Attempting to fetch from ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/distfiles//.
> Requesting ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/distfiles//bison-1.25.tar.gz (via ftp://orpheus.amdahl.com:80/)
> Successfully retrieved file.

Generate the checksum of the distfile into files/md5:

> root@pumpy:/u/pkgsrc/lang/bison(1770)# make makesum

Now compile:

> root@pumpy:/u/pkgsrc/lang/bison(1777)# make

Everything seems OK, so install the files:

> >> Checksum OK for bison-1.25.tar.gz.

You can now use bison, and also - if you decide so - remove it with
"pkg_delete bison-1.25". Should you decide that you want a binary package,
do this now:

> root@pumpy:/u/pkgsrc/lang/bison(1786)# make package
> >> Checksum OK for bison-1.25.tar.gz.
> ===>  Building package for bison-1.25
> Creating package bison-1.25.tgz
> Registering depends:.
> Creating gzip'd tar ball in '/u/pkgsrc/lang/bison/bison-1.25.tgz'

Now that you don't need the source and object files any more, clean up:

> root@pumpy:/u/pkgsrc/lang/bison(1787)# make clean
