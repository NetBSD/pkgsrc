The rna-seq meta-package provides the core tools needed for performing
a typical RNA-Seq differential gene expression analysis, including
adapter trimming, quality control, alignment, and identification of
differentially expressed genes.  Researchers may want additional tools
for data manipulation, gene ontology, etc.
