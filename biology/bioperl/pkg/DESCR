  The Bioperl project is a coordinated effort to collect computational
methods routinely used in bioinformatics into a set of standard
CPAN-style, well-documented, and freely available Perl modules.  Perl
provides unparalleled support for many tasks common in bioinformatics
yet there are no standard Perl modules for biology.  Bioperl hopes to
help fill this void. 

  Bioperl modules and source code will always be freely available
under the same terms as Perl itself.  The Bioperl project is open to
all and we invite suggestions and participation from the larger
bioinformatics community.
