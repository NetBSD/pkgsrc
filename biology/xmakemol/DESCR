XMakemol is a mouse-based program, written using the LessTif widget set,
for viewing and manipulating atomic and other chemical systems. It reads XYZ
input and renders atoms, bonds and hydrogen bonds.

Features include:

 - Animating multiple frame files
 - Interactive measurement of bond lengths, bond angles and torsion angles
 - Control over atom/bond sizes
 - Exporting to Xpm, Encapsulated PostScript and XYZ formats
 - Toggling the visibility of groups of atoms
 - Editing the positions of subsets of atoms

This version incorporates the latest patches from Debian, which provide
additional tuning of H-bond detection.
