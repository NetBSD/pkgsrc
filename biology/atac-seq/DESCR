The atac-seq meta-package provides the core tools needed for performing
a typical ATAC-Seq differential accessibility analysis, including
adapter trimming, quality control, alignment, peak calling, and
identification of differentially accessible peaks.  Researchers may
want additional tools for data manipulation, gene ontology, etc.
