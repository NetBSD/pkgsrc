HMMER is an implementation of profile HMM methods for sensitive database 
searches using multiple sequence alignments as queries. HMMER takes 
multiple sequence alignement as input and builds statistical model 
called "Hidden Markov Model" which can be used as a query into a 
sequence database to find and/or align additional homologues of the 
sequence family.
