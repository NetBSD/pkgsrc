DEC Tru64/OSF1 compatibility package based upon the Tru64/OSF1
shared libraries provided by Compaq to support running Netscape on
Linux/Alpha.

This package supports running Tru64/OSF1 binaries that do not make use
of MACH system calls.

Note that this is not a complete set of Tru64/OSF1 shared libraries, 
but rather the minimal set required to run netscape.
