Since VMware 3.x, there is a problem which might be related to shared
memory under Linux emulation, giving as a result black screen.
Unfortunately, it's extremely hard to track down what's going on and this
is as yet unresolved.

If you experience this problem, setting your DISPLAY environment variable
to "localhost:0" should help.
