This package supplies the user files necessary for full compatibility with
dynamically linked executables compiled under NetBSD 1.1 through 1.2.1. 
You still need the option COMPAT_12 in your kernel configuration (and
probably others; see options(4) for more information) to make use of
NetBSD 1.2 binaries.
