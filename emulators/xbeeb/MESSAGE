You must copy the BBC "BASIC2" ROM image to

	${PREFIX}/${XBEEBROOT}/roms/BASIC2.rom

and the BBC "OS1.2" ROM image to

	${PREFIX}/${XBEEBROOT}/roms/OS1.2.rom

As an alternative to extracting these ROM images from your own BBC hardware,
archives of these ROM images may also be found at:

	http://bbc.nvg.org/rom/Acorn/lang/BASIC2.rom
	http://bbc.nvg.org/rom/Acorn/os/OS-1.2.rom

The emulator expects files in the chosen directory to have matching
<filename>.inf files containing the BBC file attributes.  This is the style
that many archives found on the Internet use.

You also need to ensure that your X session can access the fonts
needed. This can be done with:

	$ xset fp+ ${PREFIX}/share/fonts/X11/xbeeb

To make the effect permanent for future X sessions, you can do this by
editing certain files in your X installation.

For example if you are only using the "startx" command to start a local
X session then you would add the above command to your ~/.xinitrc
script.

If you're running a local X server from xdm then you would need to set
the complete set of font directories in the xdm/Xservers file with the
'-fp' option common to all X servers.

If you are using the X font server (xfs) then you would add the
intlfonts install directory to the xfs/config file in the comma
separated list of directories given for the "catalogue" setting.
For example:

	catalogue = ${PREFIX}/lib/X11/fonts/misc/,
		  ${PREFIX}/lib/X11/fonts/Speedo/,
		  ${PREFIX}/lib/X11/fonts/Type1/,
		  ${PREFIX}/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi/,
		  ${PREFIX}/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi/,
		  ${PREFIX}/share/fonts/X11/xbeeb/
