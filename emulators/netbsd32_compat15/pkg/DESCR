This package supplies the user files necessary for full compatibility with
dynamically linked executables compiled under NetBSD 1.5, on a 32-bit
platform, running on a 64-bit host..  You still need the options COMPAT_15
and COMPAT_NETBSD32 in your kernel configuration (and probably others; see
options(4) for more information) to make use of NetBSD 1.5 binaries.
