Supermodel emulates Sega's Model 3 arcade platform, allowing you to play a
number of ground-breaking arcade classics on your PC. It uses OpenGL and
the SDL library.

Model 3 first made its debut in 1996 with Virtua Fighter 3 and Scud Race,
and for the subsequent two years boasted the most powerful 3D hardware of
any gaming platform.
