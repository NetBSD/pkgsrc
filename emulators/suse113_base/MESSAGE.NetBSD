Do not forget to include COMPAT_LINUX in your kernel configuration file.
Linux binaries require this option in order to work.

Most Linux binaries also require procfs to be mounted with -o linux.
This can be automated by adding the following to your /etc/fstab:

procfs /${EMULSUBDIR}/proc procfs ro,linux

Some Linux binaries also require tmpfs to be mounted on /dev/shm.
This can be automated by adding the following to your /etc/fstab:

tmpfs /${EMULSUBDIR}/dev/shm tmpfs rw,-m1777
