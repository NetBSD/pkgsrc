Aliados is a CP/M 80 emulator that instead of emulate a machine and
run some variant of CP/M on it, emulates only the microprocessor and
captures all CP/M system calls to execute it natively.  Actually only
emulates a small part of CP/M, but with that already can execute many
programs, such as WordStar, Microsoft Basic, Mallard Basic, Hi-Tech C,
Turbo Pascal and many others.  Aliados does not need to create disk
images, it reads and writes in the native filesystem all files that
match the CP/M name conventions.
