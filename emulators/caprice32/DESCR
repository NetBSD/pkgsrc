Caprice32 is a software emulator of the Amstrad CPC 8bit home computer
series. The emulator faithfully imitates the CPC464, CPC664, and CPC6128
models. By recreating the operations of all hardware components at a
low level, the emulator achieves a high degree of compatibility with
original CPC software. These programs or games can be run unmodified at
real-time or higher speeds, depending on the emulator host environment.
