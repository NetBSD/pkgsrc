Libretro is a simple but powerful development interface that allows for the
easy creation of emulators, games and multimedia applications that can plug
straight into any libretro-compatible frontend. This development interface is
open to others so that they can run these pluggable emulator and game cores
also in their own programs or devices.

Mednafen PSX (Beetle PSX) is a Sony PlayStation 1 video game system emulator
that can be used as a libretro core. It is a libretro port of Mednafen
PlayStation.

Mednafen can load CD-ROM games from a ripped/dumped copy of the disc, such
as CUE+BIN. Additionally there is support for CloneCD "CCD/IMG/SUB" rips,
and cdrdao "TOC" files. A CUE file is required.

This is the OpenGL version. It is currently less accurate than the software
renderer but will enable and/or speed up enhancements like upscaling and
texture filtering.
