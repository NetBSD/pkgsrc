The GNU binutils package contains essential tools to assemble, link and
manipulate binary and object files. They are often used with a compiler
and additional libraries for building software.

It includes the GNU linker, the portable GNU assembler, ar for modifying
archives (such as libraries), nm for listing symbols from object files,
objdump for displaying object file information, ranlib for generating
archive indexes, size for listing section sizes of object files,
strings for outputing the printable characters in files, strip for
stripping out symbols (like debugging information) from object files,
and other tools.
