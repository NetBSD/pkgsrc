The Hewlett-Packard IA-64 instruction set simulator

ski is an itanium or ia64 instruction set simulator.  It can be used
for user or operating system development.  It can be run in batch,
curses, gtk, or graphical (motif) modes, where you can inspect code,
set breakpoints, and so on.

BUGS: manual pages out of date, rpm build target broken, ctrl-c breaks
      curses ski program not emulator, doesn't decode source code yet,
      "cstack" and "pm" commands not implemented for NetBSD,
      probably others.
