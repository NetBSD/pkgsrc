The Hewlett-Packard IA-64 instruction set simulator

To get the ski to run on NetBSD/i386, you need the following:

procfs support in the kernel:

mount /dev/pts:

Run the ski binary from within an xterm window.

BUGS: manual pages out of date, rpm build target broken, ctrl-c breaks
      curses ski program not emulator, doesn't decode source code yet,
      "cstack" and "pm" commands not implemented, probably others.
