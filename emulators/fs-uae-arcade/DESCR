FS-UAE is an Amiga emulator for Windows, Linux and Mac OS X based on
UAE/WinUAE, with a focus on emulating games.

Features include emulation of Amiga 500, 1200, 4000, CD32 and CDTV,
perfectly smooth scrolling on 50Hz displays, support for floppy images in
ADF and IPF formats, CD-ROM images in ISO or BIN/CUE format, mounting folders
on your computer as Amiga hard drives, support for Picasso 96 drivers for
high-color and high-resolution Workbench displays, and more...

A unique feature is support for cross-platform online play. You can now play
Amiga games against (or with) friends over the Internet.

The emulator uses the latest Amiga emulation code from the WinUAE project
and requires a moderately fast computer with accelerated graphics (OpenGL)
to work. A game pad or joystick is recommended, but not required (FS-UAE
can emulate a joystick using the cursor keys and right ctrl/alt keys).
