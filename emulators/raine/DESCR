Raine is an emulator, it emulates some M68000 and M68020 arcade games and is 
mainly focused on Taito and Jaleco games hardware. It started as an experiment 
with the Rainbow Islands romset, dumped by Aracorn/Romlist. Raine can emulate 
many nice games now, including new additions from Cave and other companies.
