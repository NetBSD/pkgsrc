VICE is a Versatile Commodore Emulator, i.e. a program that runs on a Unix
or MS-DOS/Windows 95 machine and executes programs intended for the old
8-bit Commodore computers. The current version emulates the C64, the C128
(save the 80 columns screen), the VIC20 and all the PET models (except the
SuperPET 9000, which is out of line anyway).
