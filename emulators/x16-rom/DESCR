This is the Commander X16 ROM containing BASIC, KERNAL, DOS and GEOS. BASIC
and KERNAL are derived from the Commodore 64 versions. GEOS is derived from
the C64/C128 version.

* BASIC is fully compatible with Commodore BASIC V2.
* KERNAL:
  -> supports the complete $FF81+ API.
  -> has the same zero page and $0200-$033C memory layout as the C64.
  -> does not support tape (device 1).
* GEOS is fully compatible with the C64 version.
