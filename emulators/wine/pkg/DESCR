Wine is a program which allows running Microsoft Windows programs
(including DOS, Windows 3.x and Win32 executables) on Unix.  It consists
of a program loader which loads and executes an Microsoft Windows binary,
and a library that implements Windows API calls using their Unix or X11
equivalents. The library may also be used for porting Win32 code into
native Unix executables.

Wine is free software, and its license (contained in the file LICENSE) is
BSD style.  Basically, you can do anything with it except claim that you
wrote it.
