pkgsurvey is a small utility to add the pkgsrc people at pkgsrc.org

Information of currently-installed packages is taken from the current
machine, along with Operating System type, hardware architecture, and
operating system release version information, and mailed to a central
site.

No information will be divulged to anyone - it is simply meant for use
by the pkgsrc people, for finding the most popular packages.

If the idea of divulging package or operating system version
information is distasteful to you, or does not conform to your site's
policy, then please feel free to delete pkgsurvey from your system: 
as root, type

	pkg_delete -v pkgsurvey
