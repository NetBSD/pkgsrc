that is constructed by including all the files that
are slurped in via
.Ql .include
directives.
This flag is mainly for debugging.

Allow other RCS Id strings than NetBSD.
Multiple strings may be concatenated with
.Ql | .
.It Fl V Ns | Ns Fl -version
Print the current
.Nm
version number and exit.
.It Fl W{[no-]warn,...}
Enable or disable specific warnings.
For a list of warnings, see below.
.It Fl e Ns | Ns Fl -explain
Print further explanations for diagnostics.
Sometimes the reasons for diagnostics are not obvious and need further
explanation.
.It Fl g Ns | Ns Fl -gcc-output-format
Use a format for the diagnostics that is understood by most programs,
especially editors, so they can provide a point-and-goto interface.
.It Fl h Ns | Ns Fl -help
Show the summary of command line options, then exit.
.It Fl i Ns | Ns Fl -import
Check if a package is ready to be imported into pkgsrc.
This is especially useful for packages from the pkgsrc-wip project.
.It Fl q Ns | Ns Fl -quiet
Don't print the errors and warnings summary before terminating.
.It Fl r Ns | Ns Fl -recursive
Check subdirectories, too.
The subdirectories are those that are mentioned in a

line.
.It Fl s Ns | Ns Fl -source
For all diagnostics having file and line number information, show the
source code along with the diagnostics.
