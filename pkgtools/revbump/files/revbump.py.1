.Sh NAME
.Nm revbump.py
.Nd tool to bump PKGREVISIONs automatically
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl hnwx
.Op Fl o Ar output
.Op Fl p Ar pkgsrcdir
.Ar category/package
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a script for pkgsrc developers that bumps PKGREVISIONs
automatically.
.Pp
.Nm
will bump the PKGREVISION of all packages that include
.Ar category/package Ap s
.Pa buildlink3.mk
recursively.
.Nm
will also increase the BUILDLINK_ABI_DEPENDS in
.Ar category/package/buildlink3.mk
and all the
.Pa buildlink3.mk
files that include this file.
The list of changed directories is provided (see
.Fl o )
for the commit.
.Pp
.Nm
supports the following options:
.Bl -tag -width 12n -offset indent
.It Fl h
Show the usage.
.It Fl n
Print the list of packages that would be bumped, but do not actually
bump them.
.It Fl o Ar output
Write the list of changed package directories (relative to the
.Pa pkgsrc
directory) to
.Ar output .
Defaults to
.Dq Pa commitlist .
.It Fl p Ar pkgsrcdir
Use
.Ar pkgsrcdir
as root of the pkgsrc tree.
Defaults to
.Pa /usr/pkgsrc .
.It Fl w
Also bump packages in the
.Pa wip/
subtree.
.It Fl x
Only bump the package given on the command line (do not recurse, do
not write a commitlist).
Use this if you generated your list of packages to bump manually.
.El
.Pp
For bumping all go packages, use
.Ar lang/go
as argument.
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Dl revbump.py devel/glib2
.Pp
will bump the PKGREVISIONs of glib2.
.Ed
.Pp
The complete procedure for a recursive dependency bump for
category/package looks like this:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
revbump.py category/package
# check for problems
cvs diff $(cat commitlist) | less
# if the diff is ok
cvs commit $(cat commitlist)
rm commitlist
