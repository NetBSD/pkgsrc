.Sh NAME
.Nm check-cvs-diff
.Nd clean up unintended revbump(1) replacements
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl hv
.Op Fl p Ar pkgsrcdir
.Ar cvs-diff-u_output-file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a Perl script for pkgsrc developers that simplifies checking and replacing
fixed version numbers of multi-version languages (e.g., Python and Ruby) in
the Makefile and buildlink3.mk files found in the resultant tree of
.Xr revbump 1 .
It reads `cvs diff -u' output written in the named input file, and if
fixed version strings are found in the diff, replaces them in the
corresponding files with the appropriate variables.
.Pp
.Nm Fl h
displays a short usage.

If
.Fl p
is given,
.Ar pkgsrcdir
is used instead of the default
.Pa /usr/pkgsrc .
.Pp
If
.Fl v
is given,
.Nm
outputs more verbose information.
.Pp
.Nm
prints the package name
(in
.Ar category/package
form) on stdout for each package where it failed, but usually none.

.Ev PKGSRCDIR
pkgsrc root directory.
Defaults to
.Pa /usr/pkgsrc .
