.Sh NAME
.Nm cddist
.Nd produce multi-CD/DVD distfile archive images
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm ""
.Op -dvd
.Op -h | --help
.Op -l logfile
.Op -dnRvV
.Op -x common_directory
.Op -X extras_directory
.Ar distfiles_directory
.Ar image_directory
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility produces ISO 9660 image files for
a multiple CD/DVD archive of pkgsrc distfiles.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility archives all files and directories found in the directory
.Ar distfiles_directory
specified on the command line.  The directory
.Ar cd_image_directory
is used as a staging area and the final ISO 9660 images are left in
that directory.  A file,
.Ar .index ,
which lists the contents of each CD/DVD will be left in the root
directory of each CD/DVD image.
.Bl -tag -width "-x directory "
.It Fl d
Enable debugging by not deleting temporary files at the end of the
run.  These files are left in TMPDIR.
.It Fl dvd
Create DVD sized images rather than the default CD-ROM sized images.
.It Fl h
.It Fl -help
Displays a short usage message.
.It Fl l Ar logfile
Log the output of mkisofs -v -v to the file
.Ar logfile .
.It Fl R
Generate a file,
.Ar README.txt ,
which will be placed in the root directory of each CD/DVD image.  This
README file contains a small amount of information about the contents
of the CD/DVD set.
.It Fl v
Be verbose.  Currently does not change things much.
.It Fl V
Print the program version number and exit.
.It Fl x Ar directory
Includes the contents of
.Ar directory
on each CD/DVD.  This is useful for README files, etc., which you want
to be present on each CD/DVD in the set.
.It Fl X Ar directory
Includes the contents of
.Ar directory
on the last CD/DVD in the set.  This is useful for adding
a pkgsrc.tar.gz tarball, i.e. a file which does not
need to be on each CD/DVD.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

Directory for holding temporary files during the image creation.
Defaults to
.Dq Li /tmp .
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
This example takes all of the distfiles found in
/usr/pkgsrc/distfiles and creates cd images in
/u2/images/disk{1,2,...}.iso.  The directories
/u2/images/disk{1,2,...} are used to create the ISO 9660 layouts.
.D1 cddist /usr/pkgsrc/distfiles /u2/images
.Pp
To include a common set of files on all CD/DVD's, place them in a
directory, /tmp/foo, in this example, and pass in the directory name
with the
.Fl x
option.
.Dl cddist -x /tmp/foo /usr/pkgsrc/distfiles /u2/images
