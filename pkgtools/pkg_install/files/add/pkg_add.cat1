     The ppkkgg__aadddd command is used to extract and upgrade packages that have
     been previously created with the pkg_create(1) command.  Packages are
     prepared collections of pre-built binaries, documentation, configura-
     tions, installation instructions and/or other files.  ppkkgg__aadddd can recur-
     sively install other packages that the current package depends on or re-
     quires from both local disk and via FTP.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
     The following command line arguments are supported:

     _p_k_g_-_n_a_m_e [_._._.]
             The named packages are installed.  _p_k_g_-_n_a_m_e may be either a URL
             or a local pathname, a package name of "-" will cause ppkkgg__aadddd to
             read from stdin.  If the packages are not found in the current
             working directory, ppkkgg__aadddd will search them in each directory
             named by the PKG_PATH environment variable.  Any dependencies re-
             quired by the installed package will be searched in the same lo-
             cation that the original package was installed from.

     --ff      Force installation to proceed even if prerequisite packages are
             not installed or the requirements script fails.  Although ppkkgg__aadddd
             will still try to find and auto-install missing prerequisite
             packages, a failure to find one will not be fatal.

     --II      If an installation script exists for a given package, do not exe-
             cute it.

     --MM      Run in MMAASSTTEERR mode.  This is a very specialized mode for running
             ppkkgg__aadddd and is meant to be run in conjunction with SSLLAAVVEE mode.
             When run in this mode, ppkkgg__aadddd does no work beyond extracting the
             package into a temporary staging area (see the --tt option), read-
             ing in the packing list, and then dumping it (prefaced by the
             current staging area) to stdout where it may be filtered by a
             program such as sed(1).  When used in conjunction with SSLLAAVVEE
             mode, it allows you to make radical changes to the package struc-
             ture before acting on its contents.

     --nn      Don't actually install a package, just report the steps that
             would be taken if it was.

     --pp _p_r_e_f_i_x
             Set _p_r_e_f_i_x as the directory in which to extract files from a
             package.  If a package has set its default directory, it will be
             overridden by this flag.  Note that only the first @@ccwwdd directive
             will be replaced, since ppkkgg__aadddd has no way of knowing which di-
             rectory settings are relative and which are absolute.  It is rare
             in any case to see more than one directory transition made, but
             when such does happen and you wish to have control over *all* di-
             rectory transitions, then you may then wish to look into the use
             of MMAASSTTEERR and SSLLAAVVEE modes (see the --MM and --SS options).

     --RR      Do not record the installation of a package.  This means that you
             cannot deinstall it later, so only use this option if you know
             what you are doing!

     --SS      Run in SSLLAAVVEE mode.  This is a very specialized mode for running
             ppkkgg__aadddd and is meant to be run in conjunction with MMAASSTTEERR mode.
             When run in this mode, ppkkgg__aadddd expects the release contents to be
             already extracted and waiting in the staging area, the location
             of which is read as a string from stdin.  The complete packing
             list is also read from stdin, and the contents then acted on as
             normal.

     --ss _v_e_r_i_f_i_c_a_t_i_o_n_-_t_y_p_e
             Use a callout to an external program to verify the binary package
             being installed against an existing detached signature file.  The
             signature file must reside in the same directory as the binary
             package.  At the present time, the following verification types
             are defined: none, gpg and pgp5.  The signature will be verified
             at install time, and the results will be displayed.  If the sig-
             nature type is anything other than none, the user will be asked
             if ppkkgg__aadddd should proceed to install the binary package.  The us-
             er must then take the decision whether to proceed or not, depend-
             ing upon the amount of trust that is placed in the signatory of
             the binary package.  Please note that, at the current time, it is
             not possible to use the verification feature when using ppkkgg__aadddd
             to add a binary package via a URL - the package, and the related
             detached signature file, must be local for the verification to
             work.

     --tt _t_e_m_p_l_a_t_e
             Use _t_e_m_p_l_a_t_e as the input to mktemp(3) when creating a ``staging
             area.''  By default, this is the string _/_v_a_r_/_t_m_p_/_i_n_s_t_m_p_._X_X_X_X_X_X,
             but it may be necessary to override it in the situation where
             space in your _/_v_a_r_/_t_m_p directory is limited.  Be sure to leave
             some number of `X' characters for mktemp(3) to fill in with a
             unique ID.

             You can get a performance boost by setting the staging area
             _t_e_m_p_l_a_t_e to reside on the same disk partition as target directo-
             ries for package file installation; often this is _/_u_s_r.

     --uu      If the package that's being installed is already installed, ei-
             ther in the same or a different version, an update is performed.
             See below for a more detailed description of the process.

     --VV      Print version number and exit.

     --vv      Turn on verbose output.

     One or more _p_k_g_-_n_a_m_e arguments may be specified, each being either a file
     containing the package (these usually ending with the ``.tgz'' suffix) or
     a URL pointing at a file available on an ftp or web site.  Thus you may
     extract files directly from their anonymous ftp or WWW locations (e.g.
     ppkkgg__aadddd ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/pack-
     ages/1.5/i386/shells/bash-2.04.tgz).  Note:  If you wish to use _p_a_s_s_i_v_e
     _m_o_d_e  ftp in such transfers, set the variable _F_T_P___P_A_S_S_I_V_E___M_O_D_E  to some
     value in your environment.  Otherwise, the more standard ACTIVE mode may
     be used.  If ppkkgg__aadddd consistently fails to fetch a package from a site
     known to work, it may be because you have a firewall that demands the us-
     age of _p_a_s_s_i_v_e _m_o_d_e  ftp.

TTEECCHHNNIICCAALL DDEETTAAIILLSS
     ppkkgg__aadddd extracts each package's "packing list" into a special staging di-
     rectory in /var/tmp (or $PKG_TMPDIR if set) and then runs through the
     following sequence to fully extract the contents of the package:

           1.   A check is made to determine if the package or another version
                of it is already recorded as installed.  If it is, installa-
                tion is terminated if the --uu option is not given.

                If the --uu option is given, it's assumed the package should be
                upgraded instead.  This is prepared by moving an existing
                _+_R_E_Q_U_I_R_E_D___B_Y file aside (if it exists), and by running
                pkg_delete(1) on the installed package.  Installation then
                proceeds as if the package was not installed, and restores the
                _+_R_E_Q_U_I_R_E_D___B_Y file afterwards.

           2.   A check is made to determine if the package conflicts (from
                @@ppkkggccffll directives, see pkg_create(1)) with an already record-
                ed as installed package.  If it is, installation is terminat-
                ed.

           3.   All package dependencies (from @@ppkkggddeepp directives, see
                pkg_create(1)) are read from the packing list.  If any of
                these required packages are not currently installed, an at-
                tempt is made to find and install it; if the missing package
                cannot be found or installed, the installation is terminated.

           4.   A search is made for any @@ooppttiioonn directives which control how
                the package is added to the system.  The only currently imple-
                mented option is @@ooppttiioonn eexxttrraacctt--iinn--ppllaaccee, which causes the
                package to be extracted directly into its prefix directory
                rather than moving it through a staging area in _/_v_a_r_/_t_m_p.

           5.   If @@ooppttiioonn eexxttrraacctt--iinn--ppllaaccee is enabled, the package is now ex-
                tracted directly into its final location, otherwise it is ex-
                tracted into the staging area.

           6.   If the package contains a _r_e_q_u_i_r_e script (see pkg_create(1)),
                it is executed with the following arguments:

                _p_k_g_-_n_a_m_e      The name of the package being installed

                IINNSSTTAALLLL       Keyword denoting to the script that it is to run
                              an installation requirements check.  (The key-
                              word is useful only to scripts which serve mul-
                              tiple functions).

                If the _r_e_q_u_i_r_e script exits with a non-zero status code, the
                installation is terminated.

           7.   If the package contains an _i_n_s_t_a_l_l script, it is executed with
                the following arguments:

                _p_k_g_-_n_a_m_e      The name of the package being installed.

                PPRREE--IINNSSTTAALLLL   Keyword denoting that the script is to perform
                              any actions needed before the package is in-
                              stalled.

                If the _i_n_s_t_a_l_l script exits with a non-zero status code, the
                installation is terminated.

           8.   If @@ooppttiioonn eexxttrraacctt--iinn--ppllaaccee is not present in the packing
                list, then it is used as a guide for moving (or copying, as
                necessary) files from the staging area into their final loca-
                tions.

           9.   If the package contains an _m_t_r_e_e_f_i_l_e file (see pkg_create(1)),
                then mtree is invoked as:
                      mmttrreeee --uu --ff _m_t_r_e_e_f_i_l_e --dd --ee --pp _p_r_e_f_i_x
                where _p_r_e_f_i_x is either the prefix specified with the --pp flag
                or, if no --pp flag was specified, the name of the first direc-
                tory named by a @@ccwwdd directive within this package.

           10.  If an _i_n_s_t_a_l_l script exists for the package, it is executed
                with the following arguments:

                _p_k_g___n_a_m_e      The name of the package being installed.

                PPOOSSTT--IINNSSTTAALLLL  Keyword denoting that the script is to perform
                              any actions needed after the package has been
                              installed.

           11.  After installation is complete, a copy of the packing list,
                _d_e_i_n_s_t_a_l_l script, description, and display files are copied
                into _/_v_a_r_/_d_b_/_p_k_g_/_<_p_k_g_-_n_a_m_e_> for subsequent possible use by
                pkg_delete(1).  Any package dependencies are recorded in the
                other packages' _/_v_a_r_/_d_b_/_p_k_g_/_<_o_t_h_e_r_-_p_k_g_>_/_+_R_E_Q_U_I_R_E_D___B_Y file (if
                the environment variable PKG_DBDIR is set, this overrides the
                _/_v_a_r_/_d_b_/_p_k_g_/ path shown above).

           12.  The staging area is deleted and the program terminates.

           13.  Finally, if we were upgrading a package, any _+_R_E_Q_U_I_R_E_D___B_Y file
                that was moved aside before upgrading was started is now moved
                back into place.

     The _i_n_s_t_a_l_l and _r_e_q_u_i_r_e scripts are called with the environment variable
     PKG_PREFIX set to the installation prefix (see the --pp option above).
     This allows a package author to write a script that reliably performs
     some action on the directory where the package is installed, even if the
     user might change it with the --pp flag to ppkkgg__aadddd.

   PPKKGG__PPAATTHH
     The value of the PKG_PATH is used if a given package can't be found, it's
     usually set to _/_u_s_r_/_p_k_g_s_r_c_/_p_a_c_k_a_g_e_s_/_A_l_l.  The environment variable should
     be a series of entries separated by semicolons.  Each entry consists of a
     directory name or URL.  The current directory may be indicated implicitly
     by an empty directory name, or explicitly by a single period.  FTP URLs
     may not end with a slash.

   PPKKGG__DDBBDDIIRR
     Where to register packages instead of _/_v_a_r_/_d_b_/_p_k_g.

   PPKKGG__TTMMPPDDIIRR
     Staging directory for installing packages, defaults to /var/tmp.  Set to
     directory with lots of free disk if you run out of space when installing
     a binary package.

     In all cases, ppkkgg__aadddd will try to install binary packages listed in de-
     pendencies list.

     You can specify a compiled binary package explicitly on the command line.

     # pkg_add /usr/pkgsrc/packages/All/tcsh-6.10.00.tgz

     If you omit the version number, ppkkgg__aadddd will install the latest version
     available.  With --vv, ppkkgg__aadddd emits more messages to terminal.

     # pkg_add -v /usr/pkgsrc/packages/All/unzip

     You can grab a compiled binary package from remote location, by specify-
     ing a URL.  The URL can be put into an environment variable, PKG_PATH.

     # pkg_add -v ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/packages/1.5/i386/All/mozilla-0.8.1.tgz

     # export PKG_PATH=ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/packages/1.5/i386/All
     # pkg_add -v mozilla

     Hard links between files in a distribution are only preserved if either
     (1) the staging area is on the same file system as the target directory
     of all the links to the file, or (2) all the links to the file are brack-
     eted by @@ccwwdd directives in the contents file, _a_n_d and the link names are
     extracted with a single ttaarr command (not split between invocations due to
     exec argument-space limitations--this depends on the value returned by
     ssyyssccoonnff(___S_C___A_R_G___M_A_X)).

     Pkg upgrading needs a lot more work to be really universal.

     Sure to be others.
