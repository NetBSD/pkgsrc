You may wish to have the vulnerabilities file downloaded daily so that
it remains current.  This may be done by adding an appropriate entry
to a user's crontab(5) entry.  For example the entry

# download vulnerabilities file
0 3 * * * ${PREFIX}/sbin/download-vulnerability-list >/dev/null 2>&1

will update the vulnerability list every day at 3AM. You may wish to do
this more often than once a day.

In addition, you may wish to run the package audit from the daily
security script.  This may be accomplished by adding the following
lines to /etc/security.local

if [ -x ${PREFIX}/sbin/audit-packages ]; then
        ${PREFIX}/sbin/audit-packages
fi

Alternatively this can also be acomplished by adding an entry to a user's
crontab(5) file. e.g.:

# run audit-packages
0 3 * * * ${PREFIX}/sbin/audit-packages

audit-packages and/or download-vulnerability-list need not be run by
the root user.  They will function as an unprivileged user, as long
as the user chosen has permission to write the pkg-vulnerabilites
to ${PKGVULNDIR}.

A sample audit-packages.conf has been installed to:

	${EGDIR}/audit-packages.conf

You may want to customise this file and copy it to
${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/audit-packages.conf.
If you want to use signature verification you will need to install GnuPG and
set the path for GPG appropriately in your audit-packages.conf.  See
audit-packages.conf(5) and audit-packages(8) for further information.
