.Sh NAME
.Nm R2pkg
.Nd create a pkgsrc package for an R package
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl DVehqv
.Op Fl E Ar editor
.Op Ar package
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
takes the name of an R
.Ar package
that should be turned into a
.Xr pkgsrc 7
package in the current directory.  The generated package includes a
.Pa Makefile
and a mostly complete set of files to get the package going.  However, the files should be reviewed and perhaps adjusted manually after 
.Nm
has finished its job.  To help with this, the original versions of files created by
.Nm
are preserved for reference.
.Pp
.Nm
is intended to help the process of creating a package but is not
intended to fly on autopilot.
.Pp
The
.Pa Makefile
contains all of the variables required for an R package, with information being taken from the package's
.Pa DESCRIPTION
file on CRAN, which is automatically fetched by
.Nm .
Likewise, the
.Pa DESCR
file is populated with information from the same file.  After
.Pa Makefile 
and
.Pa DESCR
are completed,
.Nm
fetches the package and computes its checksum via the
.Ic makesum
target.  Then the package is extracted via the
.Ic extract
target.
.Pp
If the user does not supply the
.Ar package
on the command line, then
.Nm
will prompt for it.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl D
Write the package's description into
.Pa DESCRIPTION .
This may be useful for verifying the information obtained from CRAN.  However, this file must be removed as it is not part of a
.Xr pkgsrc 7
package.
.It Fl E Ar editor
Use
.Ar editor 
instead of the user's default editor.
.It Fl V
Print the version.
.It Fl e
Do not edit Makefile and DESCR.
.It Fl h
Produce a short help message.
.It Fl q
Do not produce status messages along the way.
.It Fl v
Generate verbose output.  This may be repeated to increase the verbosity.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The following environment variables affect the execution of
.Nm :
.Bl -tag -width BLOCKSIZE
.It Ev PKGEDITOR, EDITOR
Editor used for editing
.Pa Makefile
and
.Pa DESCR .
.It Ev CRAN_URL
The URL to the CRAN mirror for downloading the package's DESCRIPTION
file.  By default,
.Pa ftp://cran.r-project.org .
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Use the following commands to create a
.Xr pkgsrc 7
package for the R package
.Ar foo :
.Dl cd pkgsrc/math
.Dl mkdir R-foo
.Dl cd R-foo
.Dl R2pkg foo
Remember to test the resulting package and remove any extra files created by
.Nm .
.Sh BUGS
.Nm
does not create a finished package; instead, it facilitates the task.
However, the resulting files must be reviewed and possibly edited by
hand.  Although dependencies are included in the generated
.Pa Makefile ,
they are only comments; no attempt is made to find corresponding
packages within 
.Xr pkgsrc 7 .
As a consequence, the category of dependencies is also not determined.
