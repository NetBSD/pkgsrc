.Sh NAME
.Nm pkgvi
.Nd run editor and make backup of given file is necessary
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility runs the user's favourite editor
on a copy of specified file.
If no changes are made in the editor, nothing happens.
Else the original file is kept as
.Pa filename.orig ,
and the modified file
is saved as
.Pa filename .
If
.Nm
finds
.Pa filename.orig ,
it behaves as normal editor and changes are only made to
.Pa filename ,
not affecting
.Pa filename.orig .
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Nm
uses $PKGEDITOR if defined, then it looks for $EDITOR,
if neither is defined, it uses
.Xr vi 1 .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr pkgdiff 1
.Sh AUTHORS
The pkgvi utility was written by
.An Tomasz Luchowski Aq zuntum@netbsd.org .
