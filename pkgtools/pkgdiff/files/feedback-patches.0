     The ffeeeeddbbaacckk--ppaattcchheess script is intended to help sending back patches in
     the NetBSD Packages Collection, pkgsrc, back to the maintainers of the
     original package, for inclusion into future releases.  The given
     _c_a_t_e_g_o_r_y_/_p_k_g is either a path relative to the pkgsrc base directory, or
     an absolute patch, which will be stripped the base directory.  A pathname
     of _. will be expanded to the current directory, which is useful when the
     current working directory is in a package's directory in pkgsrc.

     If an email address is given, the patches will be sent to that address,
     with some nice words. If no email address is given, the mail will only be
     displayed instead of sent.

     The command:

           feedback-patches audio/gqmpeg

     will display a mail that can be sent to the gqmpeg people with patches to
     include.

           feedback-patches somecat/dunno whoever@foobar.baz

     will invoke mail(1) to send the patches back immediately.

           feedback-patches /usr/pkgsrc/somecat/dunno whoever@foobar.baz

     works just as well, you can use either full path or path relative to
     pkgsrc base when specifying a package. As you're usually already in the
     pkg's directory for finding out the contact address (probably by looking
     at the HOMEPAGE variable in the pkg's Makefile), you can also do:

           cd .../category/pkg
           feedback-patches `pwd` whoever@foobar.baz

     or

           cd .../category/pkg
           feedback-patches  . whoever@foobar.baz

     The feedback-patches utility was written by Hubert Feyrer
     <hubertf@NetBSD.org>.

BBUUGGSS
     Currently the pkgsrc base directory is hardcoded to _/_u_s_r_/_p_k_g_s_r_c.
