     The ppkkggvvii utility runs the user's favourite editor on a copy of specified
     file.  If no changes are made in the editor, nothing happens.  Else the
     original file is kept as _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e_._o_r_i_g, and the modified file is saved as
     _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e.  If ppkkggvvii finds _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e_._o_r_i_g, it behaves as normal editor and
     changes are only made to _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e, not affecting _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e_._o_r_i_g.  In both
     cases ppkkggvvii ensures that the file to be edited is writable by the user.

     Available option:

     ++ccoommmmaanndd
             This option is passed unmodified as first argument to the editor.
             This is useful when the editor used is vi(1).

     ppkkggvvii uses $PKGEDITOR if defined, then it looks for $EDITOR, if neither
     is defined, it uses vi(1).
