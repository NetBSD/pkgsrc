This package provides a shared library and a replacement for
sysctl(1) (when needed i.e. when the original one is statically linked)
so that the real version numbers and strings of the running NetBSD
kernel as returned by sysctl(3) and uname(3) are overridden by
those fixed during compilation.

This is useful for -among other things- building packages in
sandboxed/chrooted environment for a different NetBSD release than the
system hosting the sandbox/chroot.
