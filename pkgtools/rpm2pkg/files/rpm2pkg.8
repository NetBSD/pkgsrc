.Sh NAME
.Nm rpm2pkg
.Nd RPM to BSD package conversion helper
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl d Ar directory
.Op Fl f Ar package_list
.Op Fl i Ar ignored_dir
.Op Fl p Ar prefix
.Op Fl s Ar strip_path_count
.Ar rpm_file ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
helps in building BSD packages from RPM files by unpacking each specified
.Ar rpm_file ,
and by building a
.Ar package_list
according to what was extracted.
The
.Ar package_list
has the format expected by the
.Nx
package system.
.Pp
.Nm
also provides a mechanism that helps in selecting what is actually
extracted from the RPM files.
It is therefore possible to reject files that are of no interest
when building a BSD package.
This is especially useful for files that are to be extracted in
.Pa /var
or
.Pa /etc .
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl d Ar directory
Change working directory to
.Ar directory .
.It Fl f Ar package_list
Produce a
.Nx
package list
.Ar package_list
from what was actually extracted from the RPM files archives.
.It Fl i Ar ignored_dir
Do not extract files contained in the
.Ar ignored_dir
directory of the RPM file's archives.
.It Fl p Ar prefix
Use
.Ar prefix
when extracting files.
.It Fl s Ar strip_path_count
Strip
.Ar strip_path_count
leading directories in file names.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Nm
.Fl d Ar /usr/pkg
.Fl f Ar /usr/pkgsrc/emulator/more_linux_lib/work/PLIST_DYNAMIC
.Fl p Ar emul/linux
.Fl i Ar tmp
.Fl i Ar var
.Fl i Ar usr/tmp
.Ar /usr/pkgsrc/distfiles/more_linux_lib/foo.rpm
.Ar /usr/pkgsrc/distfiles/more_linux_lib/bar.rpm
.Pp
This will extract
.Pa foo.rpm
and
.Pa bar.rpm
into
.Pa /usr/pkg/emul/linux .
A packing list called
.Pa PLIST_DYNAMIC
will be created, with pathnames relative to
.Pa /usr/pkg ,
because this is the directory into which we asked
.Nm
to change with the
.Fl d
option.
.Pp
.Nm
will not extract files contained in the
.Pa tmp ,
.Pa var ,
or
.Pa usr/tmp
directories of the RPM file's archives.
.Pp
.Nm
.Fl s Ar 1
.Fl d Ar /usr/pkg
.Ar /usr/pkgsrc/distfiles/pack/bar.rpm
.Pp
This will extract the
.Ar bar.rpm
file in
.Pa /usr/pkg
while striping the leading directory of files path in
.Ar bar.rpm .
This is useful for dealing with RPM archives that contains files like
.Pa usr/bin/foo ,
which you would like to go in
.Pa /usr/pkg/bin .
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
.Nm
should work with any regular RPM file.
