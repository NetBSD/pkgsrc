.Ss Options
.Bl -tag -width 18n
.It Fl C{[no-]check,...}
Enable or disable specific checks.
For a list of checks, see below.
.It Fl D{[no-]debug,...}
Enable or disable debugging categories.
For a list of categories, see below.
.It Fl F Ns | Ns Fl -autofix
Repair trivial things automatically.
.It Fl I
Show the
.Pa Makefile
that is constructed by including all the files that
are slurped in via
.Ql .include
directives.
This flag is mainly for debugging.
.It Fl R Ns | Ns Fl -rcsidstring
Allow other RCS Id strings than NetBSD.
Multiple strings may be concatenated with
.Ql | .
.It Fl V Ns | Ns Fl -version
Print the current
.Nm
version number and exit.
.It Fl W{[no-]warn,...}
Enable or disable specific warnings.
For a list of warnings, see below.
.It Fl e Ns | Ns Fl -explain
Print further explanations for diagnostics.
Sometimes the reasons for diagnostics are not obvious and need further
explanation.
.It Fl g Ns | Ns Fl -gcc-output-format
Use a format for the diagnostics that is understood by most programs,
especially editors, so they can provide a point-and-goto interface.
.It Fl h Ns | Ns Fl -help
Show the summary of command line options, then exit.
.It Fl i Ns | Ns Fl -import
Check if a package is ready to be imported into pkgsrc.
This is especially useful for packages from the pkgsrc-wip project.
.It Fl q Ns | Ns Fl -quiet
Don't print the errors and warnings summary before terminating.
.It Fl r Ns | Ns Fl -recursive
Check subdirectories, too.
The subdirectories are those that are mentioned in a
.Ql SUBDIR+=
line.
.It Fl s Ns | Ns Fl -source
For all diagnostics having file and line number information, show the
source code along with the diagnostics.
