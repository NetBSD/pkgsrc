.Dt PKGLINT 1
.Sh NAME
.Nm pkglint
.Nd a verifier for pkgsrc directories
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm pkglint
.Op Fl options
.Op Ar dir ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
attempts to detect features of the named pkgsrc packages that are likely
to be bugs, or that are simply deprecated.
The pkgsrc system is changing rapidly towards even more portability.
The job of
.Nm
is to define the rules that make up
.Dq good
packages and to allow automatic conformance tests.
Packages following these rules are assumed to make future changes to the
pkgsrc infrastructure easier.

.\" =======================================================================
.Sy Options
.Bl -tag -width 18n -offset indent
.It Fl C{[no-]check,...}
Enable or disable specific checks.
For a list of checks, see below.
.It Fl F Ns | Ns Fl -autofix
Repair trivial things automatically.
Currently this only works for the synchronization of category
.Pa Makefile Ns
s.
.It Fl I
Show the
.Pa Makefile
that is constructed by including all the files that
are slurped in via
.Ql .include
directives.
This flag is mainly for debugging.
.It Fl R Ns | Ns Fl -rcsidstring
Allow other RCS Id strings than NetBSD.
Multiple strings may be concatenated with
.Ql | .
.It Fl V Ns | Ns Fl -version
Print the current
.Nm
version number and exit.
.It Fl W{[no-]warn,...}
Enable or disable specific warnings.
For a list of warnings, see below.
.It Fl d Ns | Ns Fl -debug
Enable warnings for parsing errors and other things that haven't been
completed yet.
This option is separated from the
.Ql -W
options because the diagnostics are too hard to understand without
detailed knowledge of pkglint's source code.
.It Fl e Ns | Ns Fl -explain
Print further explanations for diagnostics.
Sometimes the reasons for diagnostics are not obvious and need further
explanation.
.It Fl g Ns | Ns Fl -gcc-output-format
Use a format for the diagnostics that is understood by most programs,
especially editors, so they can provide a point-and-goto interface.
.It Fl h Ns | Ns Fl -help
Show the summary of command line options, then exit.
.It Fl i Ns | Ns Fl -import
Check if a package is ready to be imported into pkgsrc.
This is especially useful for packages from the pkgsrc-wip project.
.It Fl q Ns | Ns Fl -quiet
Don't print the errors and warnings summary before terminating.
.It Fl r
Check subdirectories, too.
The subdirectories are those that are mentioned in a
.Ql SUBDIR+=
line.
.It Fl s Ns | Ns Fl -source
For all diagnostics having file and line number information, show the
source code along with the diagnostics.
.It Fl v Ns | Ns Fl -verbose
Be verbose.
Show the progress report for items that are being checked.
If given more than once, debugging messages are also shown.

errors.
.It OK: ...
Informational messages are only written in verbose mode
