<title>The &pkglint; type system</title>

	<para>One of the most notable additions to &pkglint; is the
	introduction of typed variables. Traditionally, in
	<filename>Makefile</filename>s, all variables have the type
	<type>String</type>. This prevents many useful checks from being
	done before executing the code.</para>

	<para>Up to 2004, &pkglint; already did some checks based on
	the value of the variables, but these checks had no common
	structure that could be described easily.</para>

<sect1 id="types.history">
<title>History</title>

	<para>In February 2005, initial support for the &pkglint; type
	system has been added. Some of the common variables have been
	assigned types such as <literal><type>Boolean</type></literal>
	or <literal><type>Yes_Or_Undefined</type></literal>, which are
	the two common ways to represent boolean variables in pkgsrc.
	The list of typed variables has been moved from the &pkglint;
	code to an external file, <filename>makevars.map</filename>.
	Many more basic types have been added later.</para>

	<para>In October 2005, the type system has been extended to
	allow <literal><type>List of
	<replaceable>simple-type</replaceable></type></literal>, which
	allowed to handle variables like <varname>DEPENDS</varname> and
	<varname>CFLAGS</varname>. One month later, enumeration types
	have been added, allowing the type of
	<varname>PTHREAD_OPTS</varname> to be expressed as <literal>List
	of { require native }</literal>.</para>

	<para>In May 2006, the definition and use of variables has been
	further restricted by introducing ACLs, which define the
	permitted operations (write, append, default, read, preprocess-read)
	depending on the current file.</para>

<sect1 id="types.semantics">
<title>Semantics of the types</title>

	<para>The <firstterm>simple types</firstterm> in &pkglint; are
	either predefined types or enumeration types. A
	<firstterm>predefined type</firstterm> is used by its name. See
	<xref linkend="types.predefined"/> for the list of predefined
	types.</para>

	<para>An expression of an enumeration type may have either of
	the enumeration-items as a value. It may not reference other
	variables.</para>

	<para>A list type can be constructed from a predefined type or
	an enumeration. It is not possible to construct lists of lists,
	since I have never needed that. There are two types of lists,
	called <literal>List</literal> and
	<literal>InternalList</literal>, which are described in the
	<ulink url="&pkgsrc-guide;/makefile.html">pkgsrc guide, the
	chapter about <filename>Makefile</filename>s</ulink>.</para>

</sect1>
<sect1 id="types.acls">
<title>Access Control Lists</title>

	<para>Additionally to the data type, which specifies
	<emphasis>what</emphasis> a variable can contain, the ACLs
	define <emphasis>where</emphasis> the variable can be defined or
	used (this is called the <firstterm>ACL subject</firstterm>) and
	which operations are allowed (these are the <firstterm>ACL
	permissions</firstterm>).</para>

	<para>The ACL subjects are specified by the filename. For
	example, <filename>Makefile</filename> and
	<filename>buildlink3.mk</filename> are valid ACL subjects. Since
	some names occur over an over in pkgsrc, these can be
	abbreviated as shown in <xref linkend="types.acl.subjects.abbr"
	/>. The character <literal>*</literal> is a placeholder for zero
	or more arbitrary characters, like in the shell. The possible
	actions on a variable are shown in <xref
	linkend="types.acl.perms" />.</para>

	<para>If a variable has no ACL definition at all, all operations
	are allowed on it. Otherwise exactly those operations of the
	first ACL entry whose subject matches the current filename are
	allowed. If no entry matches, nothing is allowed.</para>

	<para>For determining if a variable is used in the correct
	place, the filename is only one part of the whole decision. The
	other one is the context in which the variable appears. There
	are many factors that influence whether the variable is used
	correctly.</para>

	<itemizedlist>

	<listitem><para>The variable may be either used at preprocessing time
	or at runtime. Some variables are defined in
	<filename>bsd.pkg.mk</filename> and thus are not available until
	that file has been included. As this should always be the very
	last thing a package includes, it practically means that these
	variables are only available at runtime.</para></listitem>

	<listitem><para>The variable may appear as the whole right hand side
	of an assignment, as a single word, or even as part of a word.
	First, the types on the right and left side should be
	compatible. Second, some variables need to be quoted correctly,
	depending on whether they are part of a word or not.</para></listitem>

	<listitem><para>In shell commands, the variable may also appear as a
	whole word or as part of a word. This is similar to the case
	above.</para></listitem>

	<listitem><para>The variable may appear inside some sort of quotes.
	For some variables this is acceptable, as they are assumed to
	never contain special characters. For others it
	isn't.</para></listitem>

	<listitem><para>The various operators in conditional statements like
	<literal>.if</literal> may further restrict the valid values.
	For example, the <varname>OPSYS</varname> variable should only
	be compared to well-known operating system names. The
	<varname>exists()</varname> function should only be called on
	pathnames. The <varname>defined()</varname> operator only checks
	if the variable is defined and does not access its
	value.</para></listitem>

	</itemizedlist>

<sect2 id="types.acls.future">
<title>Future Directions</title>

	<para>Currently the ACLs only cover the <quote>user
	space</quote> of pkgsrc. They will be extended later to also
	check for valid variable definition and use in the pkgsrc
	infrastructure, as well as the user configuration file. For
	completeness, those variables that are intended to be specified
	on the command line will be added to the
	<filename>makevars.map</filename> file.</para>

<title>Different interpretation of the same data types</title>

	<para>As explained above, there are internal lists and external
	lists in pkgsrc. But that is not the only attribute that a list
	can have. They also differ in the way they are defined, which
	files may access them, and what it means to append to append a
	value to it.</para>

	<para>For example, <varname>NOT_FOR_PLATFORM</varname> is a list
	that every file may append to without leading to unexpected
	behavior. Compare this with
	<varname>ONLY_FOR_PLATFORM</varname>, which should only be set
	in a single place throughout pkgsrc. Let's say in the package
	<filename>Makefile</filename> it is set to
	<literal>NetBSD-*-*</literal>, because this file's author knows
	for sure that the package is only usable on NetBSD. Now when
	some <filename>*.mk</filename> file from a dependency package
	adds <literal>DragonFly-*-*</literal> to it, the intent of the
	package <filename>Makefile</filename> is undermined by the
	dependency package, because now it is possible to build the
	package on DragonFly, too.</para>

	<para>The same problem arises with the various variables that
	can be either <literal>yes</literal> or undefined. They should
	always be chosen so that two definitions in different files
	don't undermine each other. A good example is
	<varname>USE_LIBTOOL</varname>, a bad example is
	<varname>NO_BUILD</varname>.</para>

	<para>TODO: What are the general properties of
	<quote>good</quote> and <quote>bad</quote> variables? How can it
	be decided of which kind a certain variable is?</para>

	<para>For most lists, the only valid operation is to append
	something at the end. Therefore it is good practice to warn if a
	list is assigned using another operator that
	<literal>+=</literal>. For <varname>SUBST_CLASSES</varname> this
	fits perfectly. But for <varname>SUBST_FILES.*</varname> it
	doesn't. Usually all occurences of a
	<varname>SUBST_FILES.*</varname> variable occur in the same
	file, and there should be no other file modifying these
	variables. Therefore it is better to use the
	<literal>=</literal> operator for the first of the
	assignments.</para>
