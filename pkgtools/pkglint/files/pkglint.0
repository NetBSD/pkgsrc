     ppkkgglliinntt attempts to detect features of the named pkgsrc packages that are
     likely to be bugs, or that are simply deprecated.  The pkgsrc system is
     changing rapidly towards even more portability.  The job of ppkkgglliinntt is to
     define the rules that make up ``good'' packages and to allow automatic
     conformance tests.  Packages following these rules are assumed to make
     future changes to the pkgsrc infrastructure easier.

           --CC{{[[nnoo--]]cchheecckk,,......}}  Enable or disable specific checks.  For a list
                               of checks, see below.

           --FF|----aauuttooffiixx        Repair trivial things automatically.  Currently
                               this only works for the synchronization of cat-
                               egory _M_a_k_e_f_i_l_es.

           --II                  Show the _M_a_k_e_f_i_l_e that is constructed by
                               including all the files that are slurped in via
                               `.include' directives.  This flag is mainly for
                               debugging.

           --RR|----rrccssiiddssttrriinngg    Allow other RCS Id strings than NetBSD.  Multi-
                               ple strings may be concatenated with `|'.

           --VV|----vveerrssiioonn        Print the current ppkkgglliinntt version number and
                               exit.

           --WW{{[[nnoo--]]wwaarrnn,,......}}   Enable or disable specific warnings.  For a
                               list of warnings, see below.

           --dd|----ddeebbuugg          Enable warnings for parsing errors and other
                               things that haven't been completed yet.  This
                               option is separated from the `-W' options
                               because the diagnostics are too hard to under-
                               stand without detailed knowledge of pkglint's
                               source code.

           --ee|----eexxppllaaiinn        Print further explanations for diagnostics.
                               Sometimes the reasons for diagnostics are not
                               obvious and need further explanation.

           --gg|----ggcccc--oouuttppuutt--ffoorrmmaatt
                               Use a format for the diagnostics that is under-
                               stood by most programs, especially editors, so
                               they can provide a point-and-goto interface.

           --hh|----hheellpp           Show the summary of command line options, then
                               exit.

           --ii|----iimmppoorrtt         Check if a package is ready to be imported into
                               pkgsrc.  This is especially useful for packages
                               from the pkgsrc-wip project.

           --qq|----qquuiieett          Don't print the errors and warnings summary
                               before terminating.

           --rr                  Check subdirectories, too.  The subdirectories
                               are those that are mentioned in a `SUBDIR+='
                               line.

           --ss|----ssoouurrccee         For all diagnostics having file and line number
                               information, show the source code along with
                               the diagnostics.

           --vv|----vveerrbboossee        Be verbose.  Show the progress report for items
                               that are being checked.  If given more than
                               once, debugging messages are also shown.

           [[nnoo--]]aabbssnnaammee        Warn if a file contains an absolute pathname.

           [[nnoo--]]ddiirreeccttccmmdd      Warn if a system command name is used instead
                               of a variable (e.g. sed instead of ${SED}).

           [[nnoo--]]eexxttrraa          Emit some additional warnings that are not
                               enabled by default, for whatever reason.

           [[nnoo--]]oorrddeerr          Warn if Makefile variables are not in the pre-

           [[nnoo--]]pplliisstt--ssoorrtt     Warn if items of a PLIST file are not sorted
                               alphabetically.  This warning is disabled by
                               default.

           [[nnoo--]]qquuoottiinngg        Warn for possibly invalid quoting of make vari-
                               ables in shell programs and shell variables
                               themselves.

           [[nnoo--]]ssppaaccee          Emit notes for inconsistent use of white-space.

           [[nnoo--]]ttyyppeess          Warn for some _M_a_k_e_f_i_l_e variables if their
                               assigned values do not match their type.

           [[nnoo--]]vvaarroorrddeerr       Warn if the variables in a package _M_a_k_e_f_i_l_es
                               are not ordered in the way it is described the

     Diagnostics are written to the standard output.

     ERROR: ...    Errors should be fixed before a package is committed to
                   pkgsrc.

     WARN: ...     Warnings generally should be fixed, but they are not as
                   critical as errors.

     OK: ...       Informational messages are only written in verbose mode
                   (--vv).  Their main use is to aid debugging.
