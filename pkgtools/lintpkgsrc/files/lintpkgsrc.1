.Dt LINTPKGSRC 1
.Sh NAME
.Nm lintpkgsrc
.Nd verifier for the pkgsrc tree
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl BDdLlmOopRrSuyz
.Op Fl E Ar file
.Op Fl g Ar pkgsrcmap
.Op Fl I Ar file
.Op Fl K Ar PACKAGES
.Op Fl M Ar DISTDIR
.Op Fl P Ar PKGSRCDIR
.Op Pa makefile ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
tries to verify the entire contents of the pkgsrc tree.
.Nm
uses simple regular-expression matching for verifying
files that make up a pkgsrc directory.
Note that it does NOT implement a complete Makefile parser.
.Ss Options
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxxx
.It Fl B
List packages marked as BROKEN.
.It Fl D Ar paths
Parse Makefiles and output contents (useful for debugging).
.It Fl d
Extract the
.Ql DEPENDS
listing from each pkgsrc package Makefile, then
verify the version specified in each DEPEND correctly matches a current
pkgsrc package.
.It Fl E Ar file
Exports the internal database generated from the pkgsrc Makefiles to a
file for faster loading at a later time.
Note that some of the stored data is, in all likelihood, dependent on
the architecture and operating system of the machine where it is
generated.
However, the database does make the task of, eg, checking for out of
date packages on a set of similarly configured machines (in the
absence of extra copies of the pkgsrc tree) both quick and possible.
.It Fl g Ar pkgsrcmap
Generate pkgsrcmap file containing an entry for each package of
.Ql pkgname pkgdir pkgver .
.It Fl h
Basic help and usage.
.It Fl I Ar file
Imports the data to construct the internal database for checking the
installed versions of packages, among other things, against the
current version found in pkgsrc.
This database provides most or all of the data required for running
.Nm
with any combination of
.Fl B ,
.Fl O ,
.Fl R ,
.Fl S ,
.Fl d ,
.Fl g ,
.Fl i ,
.Fl p ,
or
.Fl u .
.It Fl i
Check the version of each installed package against the current version in
pkgsrc.
.It Fl K Ar PACKAGES
Override binary packages base directory, normally set from
.Pa @MAKECONF@
or defaulted to
.Pa ${PKGSRCDIR}/packages .
.Pp
Note: lintpkgsrc treats
.Em PACKAGES
slightly differently to the pkgsrc build system.
.Fl p
and
.Fl R
check for
binary packages in any depth of PACKAGES subdirs - this allows packages for all
architectures/OS versions to be checked simultaneously with a
.Pa @MAKECONF@
construct of the form:
.Bd -literal
\&.ifdef LINTPKGSRC
PACKAGES=${PKGSRCDIR}/packages
\&.else
PACKAGES=${PKGSRCDIR}/packages/${OS_VERSION}/${MACHINE_ARCH}
\&.endif
.Ed
.Pp
Which would be an alternative to
.Fl K .
.It Fl L
List the filenames of Makefiles as they are parsed (for debugging).
.It Fl M Ar DISTDIR
Set directory for distfiles, defaults to
.Pa ${PKGSRCDIR}/distfiles .
.It Fl m
For each current distfile, verify its checksum against the appropriate
package's distinfo file.
Also report if any package's distinfo file references
the same distfile with a different distinfo checksum.
.It Fl O
Report any binary packages in any subdirs of
.Em PACKAGES ,
for whom the source Makefile lists
.Em OSVERSION_SPECIFIC .
This is intended to help those making binary packages available for ftp.
.It Fl o
Report any old distfiles (not referenced by any package's distinfo file).
.It Fl P Ar PKGSRCDIR
Set base of pkgsrc tree, normally set from
.Pa @MAKECONF@
or defaulted to
.Pa @PREFIX@ .
.It Fl p
Report any old binary packages in any subdirs of
.Em PACKAGES .
.It Fl R
Report any binary packages in any subdirs of
.Em PACKAGES ,
for whom the source Makefile lists
.Em NO_BIN_ON_FTP
or
.Em RESTRICTED .
This is intended to help those making binary packages available for ftp.
.It Fl r
Remove distfiles which are not referenced from any package's distinfo file,
or have an incorrect checksum (usually due to an interrupted download),
and any old binary packages.
To remove any given type, additionally specify the
.Fl o ,
.Fl m ,
or
.Fl p
flags respectively.
.It Fl S
List packages missing from category
.Em SUBDIR
lists.
.It Fl u
As
.Fl i
plus for mismatched packages, display REQUIRED details and run
.Ql @MAKE@ fetch-list | sh
to ensure all the distfiles needed for
the latest version are present.
.Pp
Warning: The behaviour of this command may change in a later version.
.It Fl y
Remove orphaned distfiles, i.e., those that do not belong to any
currently installed package.
.It Fl z
Remove distfiles for currently installed packages.

.Sh BUGS
The
.Fl R
and
.Fl p
options default to using
.Em PACKAGES
as the base directory from which to
search for binary packages.
If this includes OS or architecture information
then packages for other OS/architecture combinations will be missed.
In this case
.Em PACKAGES
can be overridden with
.Fl K
or set conditionally in
.Pa @MAKECONF@
based on the value of
.Em LINTPKGSRC .
.Pp
The
.Ql Makefile parsing
algorithm used to obtain package versions
and DEPENDS information is geared towards speed rather than
perfection, though it has got somewhat better over time, it only
parses the simplest Makefile conditionals.
(a == b, no \*[Am]\*[Am] etc).
.Pp
Potentially others, but non serious to date.
