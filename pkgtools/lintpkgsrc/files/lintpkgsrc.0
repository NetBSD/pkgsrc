     lliinnttppkkggssrrcc tries to verify the entire contents of the pkgsrc tree.
     lliinnttppkkggssrrcc uses simple regular-expression matching for verifying files
     that make up a pkgsrc directory.  Note that it does NOT implement a com-
     plete Makefile parser.

   OOppttiioonnss
     --BB            List packages marked as BROKEN.

     --DD _p_a_t_h_s      Parse Makefiles and output contents (useful for debugging).

     --dd            Extract the `DEPENDS' listing from each pkgsrc package
                   Makefile, then verify the version specified in each DEPEND
                   correctly matches a current pkgsrc package.

     --EE _f_i_l_e       Exports the internal database generated from the pkgsrc
                   Makefiles to a file for faster loading at a later time.
                   Note that some of the stored data is, in all likelihood,
                   dependent on the architecture and operating system of the
                   machine where it is generated.  However, the database does
                   make the task of, eg, checking for out of date packages on
                   a set of similarly configured machines (in the absence of
                   extra copies of the pkgsrc tree) both quick and possible.

     --gg _p_k_g_s_r_c_m_a_p  Generate pkgsrcmap file containing an entry for each pack-
                   age of `pkgname pkgdir pkgver'.

     --hh            Basic help and usage.

     --II _f_i_l_e       Imports the data to construct the internal database for
                   checking the installed versions of packages, among other
                   things, against the current version found in pkgsrc.  This
                   database provides most or all of the data required for run-
                   ning lliinnttppkkggssrrcc with any combination of --BB, --OO, --RR, --SS, --dd,
                   --gg, --ii, --pp, or --uu.

     --ii            Check the version of each installed package against the
                   current version in pkgsrc.

     --KK _P_A_C_K_A_G_E_S   Override binary packages base directory, normally set from
                   _@_M_A_K_E_C_O_N_F_@ or defaulted to _$_{_P_K_G_S_R_C_D_I_R_}_/_p_a_c_k_a_g_e_s.

                   Note: lintpkgsrc treats _P_A_C_K_A_G_E_S slightly differently to
                   the pkgsrc build system.  --pp and --RR check for binary pack-
                   ages in any depth of PACKAGES subdirs - this allows pack-
                   ages for all architectures/OS versions to be checked simul-
                   taneously with a _@_M_A_K_E_C_O_N_F_@ construct of the form:

                   .ifdef LINTPKGSRC
                   PACKAGES=${PKGSRCDIR}/packages
                   .else
                   PACKAGES=${PKGSRCDIR}/packages/${OS_VERSION}/${MACHINE_ARCH}
                   .endif

                   Which would be an alternative to --KK.

     --LL            List the filenames of Makefiles as they are parsed (for
                   debugging).

     --MM _D_I_S_T_D_I_R    Set directory for distfiles, defaults to
                   _$_{_P_K_G_S_R_C_D_I_R_}_/_d_i_s_t_f_i_l_e_s.

     --mm            For each current distfile, verify its checksum against the
                   appropriate package's distinfo file.  Also report if any
                   package's distinfo file references the same distfile with a
                   different distinfo checksum.

     --OO            Report any binary packages in any subdirs of _P_A_C_K_A_G_E_S, for
                   whom the source Makefile lists _O_S_V_E_R_S_I_O_N___S_P_E_C_I_F_I_C.  This is
                   intended to help those making binary packages available for
                   ftp.

     --oo            Report any old distfiles (not referenced by any package's
                   distinfo file).

     --PP _P_K_G_S_R_C_D_I_R  Set base of pkgsrc tree, normally set from _@_M_A_K_E_C_O_N_F_@ or
                   defaulted to _@_P_R_E_F_I_X_@.

     --pp            Report any old binary packages in any subdirs of _P_A_C_K_A_G_E_S.

     --RR            Report any binary packages in any subdirs of _P_A_C_K_A_G_E_S, for
                   whom the source Makefile lists _N_O___B_I_N___O_N___F_T_P or _R_E_S_T_R_I_C_T_E_D.
                   This is intended to help those making binary packages
                   available for ftp.

     --rr            Remove distfiles which are not referenced from any pack-
                   age's distinfo file, or have an incorrect checksum (usually
                   due to an interrupted download), and any old binary pack-
                   ages.  To remove any given type, additionally specify the
                   --oo, --mm, or --pp flags respectively.

     --SS            List packages missing from category _S_U_B_D_I_R lists.

     --uu            As --ii plus for mismatched packages, display REQUIRED
                   details and run `@MAKE@ fetch-list | sh' to ensure all the
                   distfiles needed for the latest version are present.

                   Warning: The behaviour of this command may change in a
                   later version.

     --yy            Remove orphaned distfiles, i.e., those that do not belong
                   to any currently installed package.

     --zz            Remove distfiles for currently installed packages.

BBUUGGSS
     The --RR and --pp options default to using _P_A_C_K_A_G_E_S as the base directory
     from which to search for binary packages.  If this includes OS or archi-
     tecture information then packages for other OS/architecture combinations
     will be missed.  In this case _P_A_C_K_A_G_E_S can be overridden with --KK or set
     conditionally in _@_M_A_K_E_C_O_N_F_@ based on the value of _L_I_N_T_P_K_G_S_R_C.

     The `Makefile parsing' algorithm used to obtain package versions and
     DEPENDS information is geared towards speed rather than perfection,
     though it has got somewhat better over time, it only parses the simplest
     Makefile conditionals.  (a == b, no && etc).

     Potentially others, but non serious to date.
