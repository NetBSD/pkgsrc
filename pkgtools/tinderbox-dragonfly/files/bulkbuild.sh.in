#
# Accepts the command ($1) and the build ($2)
# The command must be "kickoff", "nextport", or "stop"
# The kickoff option will:
#    - delete ${BULKTMP}/bulk_${BUILD}.active
#    - delete ${BULKTMP}/bulk_${BUILD}.processed
#    - delete ${BULKTMP}/bulk_${BUILD}.requested
#    - create or recreate ${BULKTMP}/bulk_${BUILD}.queue
#    - execute "nextport" option
# The nextport option is called only if kickoff was stopped before.
#   If there is no ${BULKTMP}/build_${BUILD}.active file, it will create one
#   with the top line of the queue file, and add that port to tinderbox queue.
# The stop option will delete the ${BULKTMP}/build_${BUILD}.active file which
#   will prevent additional ports from being added to the queue.  The
#   previously added port will continue to build along with all it's
#   dependencies though.
