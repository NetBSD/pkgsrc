    Tinderbox is a package building system for FreeBSD ports, based on
    official Portbuild scripts used on pointyhat building cluster.

    You can define multiple jails (base system versions) and multiple
    portstrees. The combination of jail and portstree is called a
    build. A Tinderbox jail is not what is understood as a jail in
-   FreeBSD, it is in fact a given world in a chroot. Tinderbox

+   FreeBSD and DragonFly, it is in fact a given world in a
+   chroot.  DragonFly uses NetBSD's pkgsrc to build software which
+   is known as "packages" rather than "ports".  Rather than update
+   DragonFly Tinderbox to change numerous references to "ports" and
+   "portstrees", the users of pkgsrc are asked to equate the term
+   "port" with "package" whenever they encounter it.
+
+   Tinderbox supports automatic tracking of dependencies and only
+   rebuilds packages that changed since last run. Tinderbox has
+   support for email notification of failed builds. Tinderbox also
+   integrates well with ccache.
 
    Tinderbox is designed to easily provide package sets of ports you
    need, for platforms and architectures you need. Tinderbox is also
    excellent tool for testing new ports and port upgrades, especially
    for testing dependencies and packing lists. It's also useful for
-   testing ports on various releases of FreeBSD, since you can run
-   FreeBSD 7.X/8.X world as a jail on a FreeBSD 9.X host.
+   testing ports on various releases of DragonFly, since you can run
+   earlier releases as a jail on the DragonFly-current.

+       Omit the "-t" option if you want the HEAD, or alternatively,
+       use -t "." instead.
 
    14. Create the required Builds using the tc command. A Build is a
        combination of a Jail and a PortsTree. The build is the object
        in which packages are created. To create a build that combines
-       a 8.2 Jail with the FreeBSD ports tree:
+       a 2.12 Jail with the DragonFly pkgsrc tree:
 
- # cd ${pb}/scripts && ./tc createBuild -b 8.2-FreeBSD -j 8.2 \
-         -p FreeBSD -d "8.2-RELEASE with FreeBSD ports tree"
+# cd ${pb}/scripts && ./tc createBuild -b 2.12-DragonFly -j 2.12 \
+        -p pkgsrc -d "2.12-RELEASE with DragonFly pkgsrc tree"
 
        Note: the recommended way to name Builds is "Jail-PortsTree".
-       All builds must also begin with their FreeBSD major version
+       All builds must also begin with their DragonFly major version
        number.
 
-     Note: tc uses cvsup12 as its default cvsup mirror. If you would
-     like to use another server or enable cvsup compression use the
-     -H and -C line arguments to the tc script respectively. For
-     example, to use cvsup2.freebsd.org and enable cvsup compression
-     for all Jail updates, use the following command:
-
- # cd ${pb}/scripts && ./tc createJail -j 8-STABLE \
-         -d "FreeBSD 8-STABLE" -t RELENG_8 -u CVSUP -C \
-         -H cvsup2.freebsd.org
-
-     Tip: It is possible to suppress spurious setuid warnings from
-     periodic if ${pb} is on a dedicated partition. Simply add the
-     nosuid flag to the partition; for UFS in /etc/fstab:
-
- /dev/ad5s1f     /usr/local/tinderbox    ufs     rw,nosuid       1       1
-
-     and for ZFS:
-
- # zfs set setuid=off $(zfs list ${pb} | tail -n 1 | cut -d ' ' -f 1)

    under the Jail or PortsTree's root directory. This script will be
    called when an update is required. For example, if you have a Jail

+   It is possible to manipulate port OPTIONS on a per-Build basis.
+   To do this, create a directory under which all build OPTIONS
+   sub-directories will go (e.g. ${pb}/options/). For each Build
+   that you wish to use to use OPTIONS, create a subdirectory
+   named for that build (e.g. 2.12-DragonFly/), and place a single
+   text file named "pkg_options" in that directory.  This file will
+   contain the customized options for every port in the build on a
+   per-distname basis.
 
    Once this structure is setup, then enable OPTIONS support in
    Tinderbox, and specify the path to the OPTIONS directory

-   OPTIONS settings will be automatically saved to the correct

+   As an example of a per-distname basis, net/wget-1.12 and 
+   net/wget-1.13.4 are considered two separate ports.  If you had set
+   the options for version 1.12, then you would have to create a new
+   entry for net/wget-1.13.4 when it's time to upgrade that port.
+
+   Each line reports a port, and the line format is as follows:
+   <PKGNAME>:<JOB OVERRIDE>:<PKGSRC OPTIONS>
+
+   The <PKGNAME> would be wget-1.13.4 in this example, not
+   wget-1.13.4nb2.  Leave off the nbX suffixes, otherwise the entry
+   will be ignored.
+
+   The <JOB OVERRIDE> is normally empty.  For single CPU systems,
+   there is no point to set this.  SMP systems will assume a job
+   number of 2 * number of CPUs + 1.  If the port crashes and it's
+   suspect that it's an jobs-unsafe issue, set <JOB OVERRIDE> to 1
+   and try the port again.
+
+   The <PKGSRC OPTIONS> is the same as you'd see in the
+   $LOCALBASE/etc/mk.conf file.
+
+   sample pkg_options file:
+   gawk-3.1.8::portals
+   gcc-4.6.1:5:-gcc-fortran -gcc-objc nls
+   heirloom-070715:1:
+
+   Note that heirloom doesn't use the options framework, but we
+   still need to have an entry for it to override the MAKE_JOBS.
+
+   Unique to Tinderbox/pkgsrc is a file named 
+   ${pb}/scripts/lib/boilerplate_mk.conf, and it contains settings
+   for mk.conf that aren't found in the standard ISO/snapshot make.conf
+   files.  For example, it sets all licenses to be skipped and to
+   build vulnerable ports.  It should not be modified since the digest
+   hash won't match when it's time to deinstall tinderbox-dragonfly.
+
+   There is another way to add settings, but on a per-build basis.  In the
+   same directory as the pkg_options file (${optionsDir}/${build}),
+   one may add a file named "more_mk.conf".  This file gets appended
+   to the standard + boilerplate make.conf.  It actively filters out
+   MAKE_JOBS and PKG_OPTIONS* settings.  Remember, pkg_options takes care
+   of those.  The file more_mk.conf should contain settings like: 
+      PYTHON_VERSION_DEFAULT= 27
+      PGSQL_VERSION_DEFAULT=  90
