.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm url2pkg
.Nd Automatic pkgsrc package generator
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl v|--verbose
.Op Ar URL
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
takes the
.Ar URL
to a package's distfile that should be turned into a package.
It fetches the distfile, extracts it, and by looking at the extracted files,
fills in some variables in the package
.Pa Makefile .
.Pp
.Nm
helps creating a package;
it is not intended to fly on autopilot, though.
Hence, after creating the package, the user's usual editor is invoked
to edit the
.Pa Makefile ,
since in almost all cases the package needs manual work.
.Pp
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It PKGEDITOR, EDITOR
Editor used for

edition.
.It PKGMAINTAINER, REPLYTO
Name used for the MAINTAINER field in the package
