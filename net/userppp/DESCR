This is the user process PPP package as found in FreeBSD and OpenBSD. 
Normally, PPP is implemented as a part of the kernel (e.g., as managed by
pppd(8)) and it's thus somewhat hard to debug and/or modify its behaviour. 
However, in this implementation PPP is done as a user process with the help
of the tunnel device driver (tun).
