nsd.db version number increased because NSD 3.2.7 and earlier zonec is
not compatible due to the TXT strings change. Please run nsdc rebuild
before running NSD 3.2.9 and later versions.

The configuration format of nsd has changed between 2.x and 3.x.
A sample Python script to help migrating the old nsd.zones format
into the new nsd.conf can be found in share/examples/nsd.
