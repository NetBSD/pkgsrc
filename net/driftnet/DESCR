Driftnet watches network traffic, and picks out and displays JPEG and GIF
images for display. It is an horrific invasion of privacy and shouldn't be used
by anyone anywhere. It can also extract MPEG audio data from the network and
play it. If you live in a house with thick walls, this may be a useful way to
find out about your neighbours' musical taste.
