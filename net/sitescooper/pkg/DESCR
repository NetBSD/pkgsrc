  Sitescooper is a perl script which you run on your Palm Computing
handheld organizer's hotsync machine.  It will retrieve news stories
automatically from various news websites and convert them into Palm
DOC, iSilo, RichReader or text format; in addition, it can now
convert into any other format for which you have a conversion program
that takes text or HTML input. 

  Multiple types of sites can be snarfed: 

     1-level sites, where the text to be converted is all present on
     one page, (such as Slashdot, Linux Weekly News, BluesNews,
     NTKnow, Ars Technica); 

     2-level sites, where the text to be converted is linked to from
     a Table of Contents page (such as Wired News, BBC News, and I,
     Cringely); 

     3-level sites, where the text to be converted is linked to from
     a Table of Contents page, which in turned is linked to from a
     list of issues page (such as PalmPower or New Scientist). 

  In addition sites that post news as items on one big page, such as
Slashdot, Ars Technica, and BluesNews, are supported using diff.
