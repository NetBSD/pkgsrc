-.SH NAME
-IRRToolSet error and warning messages
-.SH DESCRIPTION
-.PP
-The goal of this document is to clarify the possible errors you may encounter when using IRRToolSet. Some of these errors are listed on the manual pages for the tools. If you didn't find the error on the manual page of the tool you were using, please refer to this page. Some errors wuth obvious explanation are listed here for reference, but to not have any documentation. Still, if description is unclear or unsufficient, please report to irrtoolset@ripe.net.
-.SH IRR communication errors
-.PP
-.B Command errors
-.PP
-.PD 0
-.P
-Error: unknown irr protocol <protocol>, using irrd
-.P
-known protocols: irrd(rawhoisd), ripe(bird), ripe_perl
-.PD 1
-.RS
-.PP
-The protocol specified with "-protocol" option is unknown or not supported. Use one of the known protocols to connect to IRR server. This option is case-insensitive. This is important which protocol to use, because some client/server protocols are incompatible, and you can get wrong result. Check IRR server documentation and use the protocols which are compatible with it. Please note that there are 3 protocols supported, and the rest are aliases (rawhoisd is the same as irrd and bird is the same as ripe). ripe_perl should be used with old ripe server.
-.PP
-.RE
-.B System errors
-.PP
-Error: gethostbyname (<hostname>) failed.
-.PP
-Error: socket() failed.
-.PP
-Error: connect() failed.
-.PP
-Error: fgets() failed.
-.PP
-Error: fread() failed.
-.PP
-Error: fwrite() failed.
-.PP
-Connection to <host>\:<port>\ failed!
-.RS
-.PP
-There could be several reasons for this error: host is unreachable, or some packet filtering is on and you can't send the packets, or the server may be not responding. Check your network setup and host reachability.
-.PP
-.RE
-Warning: setsockopt SO_KEEPALIVE failed!
-.RS
-.PP
-All protocols supported by IRRToolSet are using persistent connection to the IRR server. When the socket for IRR connection is created, SO_KEEPALIVE option is set to enable persistent connection (client has to keep checking if the destination is still alive). See setsockopt(2) manual page for details about possible failures.
-.PP
-.RE
-.B IRR-specific errors
-.PP
-Error: setting source to <sources>\ failed.
-.RS
-.PP
-One (or several) sources from <sources> list are not found on IRR server. If the source setting for IRR server failed, the source list will be default one.
-Check IRR server documentation for the proper command to get the list of all available sources and default sources. This check is only implemented for irrd(rawhoisd). If you mistyped the source name, re-run the program using "-s <sources>" option.
-.PP
-.RE
-Error: current source setting is <sources>\.
-.RS
-.PP
-This is rather informational message, preceeded by error message about failed sources setting. It shows the source list which is used currently by the program for querying. If you want to modify this list, use "-s <sources>" option.
-.PP
-.RE
-Warning: irrd(rawhoisd) does not yet support rtr-set expansion.
-.RS
-.PP
-Although as-set and route-set expansion is an internal feature of irrd, rtr-set expansion is not implemented yet. In IRRToolSet it is done by external functions, but it still works. So you can safely ignore this warning, this is just a reminder to keep an eye on irrd development and update the code to use internal feature when it is implemented.
-.PP
-.RE
-Warning: key not found error for query <last_query>
-.RS
-.PP
-Object not found in the database for specified sources. <last_query> specifies the actual query to the server which returned to objects. The reason can be:
-.PD 0
-.IP \(bu 2
-object, source or host name are mistyped and therefore object cannot be found;
-.IP \(bu 2
-this is true error and you're referencing non-existent object, which is supposed to be in the database; check your objects and policy description.
-.PD 1
-.PP
-.RE
-Warning: no byte count error for query <last_query>\.
-.RS
-.PP
-irrd server returns the length of the reply for successful queries with "A<reply length in bytes including newlines>". The program is expecting it if query is successful. If it is not received, the warning is issued. This error can also indicate protocol/server incompatibility (for example, RIPE whois server with irrd protocol). Please check IRR server documentation for details.
-.PP
-.RE
-Warning: no end of data line error for query <last_query>\.
-.RS
-.PP
-After a successful query irrd server issues special "end of data" command, "C". If it is not received after <length of reply> bytes of data, the program complains. This can indicate that query was broken, or incomplete, or some other server error occured. Please check IRR server documentation for details or ask IRR server administration for help.

-.RE
-.SH RPSL parser errors
-.B Lexer errors
-.PP
-Error: unknown class <yytext>
-.RS
-.PP
-Wrong first attribute of the object. This attribute is considered RPSL class name, and determines the object type. The rest of object's attributes can have any order, but the first one should be on the first place.
-.PP
-.RE
-Error: unknown attribute <attr> of class <class> 
-.RS
-.PP
-Wrong attribute of the object. The attribute is a string followed by ":" which  describes the type of data after ":". Object consists of "attribute:value" pairs. For more information on RPSL classes, see RFC 2622.
-.PP
-.RE
