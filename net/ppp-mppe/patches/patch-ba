+Just a few quick notes.
+
+MPPE support was started by Árpád Magosányi <mag@bunuel.tii.matav.hu> in 1994,
+and was finished by Tim Hockin, Cobalt Networks Inc. <thockin@cobaltnet.com>
+in 1999.  If you helped, and I don't know it (which could be) please notify
+the maintainer of this code, and it will be rectified.  As far as I know, only i
+Linux is supported (sorry - it's all we had available).
+
+MPPE - Microsoft Point-to-Point Encryption uses rc4 (40 or 128 bit) as a
+bi-directional encryption algorithm.  The keys are based on your MS-CHAP 
+authentication info, so you must use chapms or chapms-v2.  Rc4 is owned by
+RSA Data Security, and you may have to pay to use it, or not use it at all,
+depending on your place of residence.  No author listed in this file claims
+any responsibility for misuse of this software.  Copyright for some code is
+owned by Eric Young (see ./linux/rc4.h for details).  Depending on where you 
+got this code from (either in patch or tar.gz form), you may need to obtain 
+the actual rc4 code from a different site.  The implementation of rc4 found in 
+the SSLeay package, by Eric Young, version 0.6.6.  This package can be found
+at ftp://ftp.psy.uq.oz.au/pub/Crypto/SSL/.  Newer versions than 0.6.6 may
+require some minor source code or header file changes.  Once obtained, copy 
+rc4.h and rc4_enc.c to the linux/ subdir of this package.
+
+This is NOT a particularly secure mode of operation.  For maximum possible 
+security using MPPE, it is advised in the RFC's to use the highest mode of
+encryption that is legal, and to enable stateless mode (which renogotiates
+keys with every packet).  Even with these precautions, MPPE is not very secure,
+but anything is better than nothing, right?
+
+That said, it seems to work pretty well, for what it is.  MSChap-v2 support 
+was added by someone along the way, and MPPE needed some finishing.  It 
+appears to work with Windows (tm) clients, with encryption specified.
+
+How to use it:
+* Compile this pppd, and teh associated kernel modules.
+* Add +chapms and/or +chapms-v2 to your pppd command line.
+* Add mppe-40 and/or mppe-128 and/or mppe-stateless to your pppd command line.
+* Either load ppp_mppe.o manually or put this line in your /etc/conf.modules.
+	alias 	ppp-compress-18 	ppp_mppe
+* Go for it.
