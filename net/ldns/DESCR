The goal of ldns is to simplify DNS programming, it supports recent
RFCs like the DNSSEC documents, and allows developers to easily
create software conforming to current RFCs, and experimental software
for current Internet Drafts. A secondary benefit of using ldns is
speed; ldns is written in C it should be a lot faster than Perl.
