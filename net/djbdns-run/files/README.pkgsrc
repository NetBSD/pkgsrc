 Getting help
 ============

You've installed an automated and customized djbdns-run package.
If you're having trouble getting the djbdns daemons to run, ask
the package's maintainer:

<URL:mailto:schmonz-nbdjbdns@schmonz.com>

If you need to ask for help on the dns list, please mention that
you're using the djbdns-run package from pkgsrc.
