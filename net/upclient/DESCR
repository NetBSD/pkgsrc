Upclient is a program that keeps track of your server
uptime, and lets you compare it with the uptime of other
(similar) hosts. It consists of two parts, a client- and a
serverpart. The client runs on your server and sends the
uptime every few minutes to the server. The server
collects all data in a table on this site.
