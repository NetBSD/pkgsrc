tnftpd is the a server for the Internet File Transfer Protocol (ftp). 
The server uses the TCP protocol and listens at the port specified in
the ``ftp'' service specification; see services(5).

`tnftpd' is a portable version of the NetBSD ftpd, hence the name.
It was formerly known as `lukemftpd'.

Various features such as the ftpd.conf(5) functionality, RFC 2389, and
draft-ietf-ftpext-mlst-11 support was implemented in NetBSD 1.3 and
later releases by Luke Mewburn <lukem@netbsd.org>.

tnftpd provides around 90% of the functionality of wuftpd, but in
approximately 30% of the footprint.
