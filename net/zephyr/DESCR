what is it?
-----------
Zephyr is a messaging service for securely delivering notification messages.
It is intended to be a sort of network equivalent of wall, only you can
target messages to particular users or classes of users rather than being
forced to broadcast to everybody regardless of whether or not they are
interested.   Messages are typically recieved either by the X client, zwgc,
or by the emacs client.
