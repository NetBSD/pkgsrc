Samba is a suite of programs which work together to allow clients to
access to a server's filespace and printers via the SMB (Server
Message Block) protocol.

In practice, this means that you can redirect disks and printers to
Unix disks and printers from Lan Manager clients, Windows for
Workgroups 3.11 clients, Windows NT clients, Linux clients and OS/2
clients. There is also a generic Unix client program supplied as part
of the suite which allows Unix users to use an ftp-like interface to
access filespace and printers on any other SMB servers. This gives the
capability for these operating systems to behave much like a LAN
Server or Windows NT Server machine, only with added functionality and
flexibility designed to make life easier for administrators.

This package tracks the Samba-2.0.x releases that include support for
the "share modes" directive that was removed in Samba-2.2.x.  The
"share modes" directive is needed to support certain legacy MS-DOS
applications.
