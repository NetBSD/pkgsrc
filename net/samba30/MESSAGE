When upgrading a Samba installation and "lock directory" has been set
to a non-default value in the configuration files, then "state directory"
needs to be set appropriately and/or the files located in the lock
directory should be moved to the state directory.  Please read the
documentation on "state directory" in the smb.conf(5) manual page for
more information.
