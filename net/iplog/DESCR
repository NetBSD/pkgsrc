iplog is a TCP/IP traffic logger.  Currently, it is capable of logging 
TCP, UDP and ICMP traffic.  Adding support for other protocols
should be relatively easy.

iplog's capabilities include the ability to detect TCP port
scans, TCP null scans, FIN scans, UDP and ICMP "smurf" attacks,
bogus TCP flags (used by scanners to detect the operating system in use), 
TCP SYN scans, TCP "Xmas" scans, ICMP ping floods, UDP scans, and IP
fragment attacks.

iplog is able to run in promiscuous mode and monitor traffic to all hosts
on a network.

iplog uses libpcap to read data from the network and can be ported
to any system that supports pthreads and on which libpcap will function.
