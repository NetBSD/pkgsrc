hping is a command-line oriented TCP/IP packet assembler/analyzer.

The interface is inspired to the ping(8) unix command, but hping isn't
only able to send ICMP echo requests. It supports TCP, UDP, ICMP and RAW-IP
protocols, has a traceroute mode, the ability to send files between a
covered channel, and many other features.
