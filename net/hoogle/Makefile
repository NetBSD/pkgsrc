# If hoogle is to be linked dynamically, it will depend on more than 160
# shared objects and the dynamic linker will spend more than a second to
# resolve symbols on startup. This is unacceptable because hoogle tends to
# be launched very frequently by editors and IDEs. This wastes storage, but
# time is more expensive than disks.
