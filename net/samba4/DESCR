Samba is the standard Windows interoperability suite of programs
for Linux and Unix.

Samba is Free Software licensed under the GNU General Public License,
the Samba project is a member of the Software Freedom Conservancy.

Since 1992, Samba has provided secure, stable and fast file and
print services for all clients using the SMB/CIFS protocol, such
as all versions of DOS and Windows, OS/2, Linux and many others.

Samba is an important component to seamlessly integrate Linux/Unix
Servers and Desktops into Active Directory environments. It can
function both as a domain controller or as a regular domain member.

This package intends to provide the current stable version of samba
within the 4.x series.  (As will all packages, it may of course
sometimes contain an older stable release due to not being updated
yet.)
