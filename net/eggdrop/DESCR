Eggdrop is an IRC bot, written in C.  If you don't know what IRC is, this
is probably not whatever you're looking for!  Eggdrop, being a bot, sits
on a channel and takes protective measures: to keep the channel from being
taken over (in the few ways that anything CAN), to recognize banished
users or sites and reject them, to recognize priveledged users and let
them gain ops, etc.

One of the more unique features of eggdrop is its "party line", accessable
via DCC chat, which allows you to talk to other people lag-free.  
Consider it a multi-way DCC chat, or a miniature IRC (complete with
channels).  You can link up with other bots and expand the party line
until it actually becomes something very much like IRC, in fact.

The preliminary documentation is in "eggdrop.doc" and is intended to be
read after you have eggdrop compiled and set up.  It's changing all the
time and getting new sections added.  If you'd like to write a section,
then please do!
