Windows Remote Management (WinRM) for Ruby

This is a SOAP library that uses the functionality in Windows Remote
Management(WinRM) to call native object in Windows.  This includes, but is
not limited to, running batch scripts, powershell scripts and fetching WMI
variables.  For more information on WinRM, please visit Microsoft's WinRM
site (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa384426.aspx).

As of version 2.0, this gem retains the WinRM name but all powershell calls
use the more modern Powershell Remoting Protocol (PSRP)
(https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd357801.aspx) for initializing
runspace pools as well as creating and processing powershell pipelines.
