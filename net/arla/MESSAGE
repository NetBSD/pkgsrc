Arla now has been installed on your system.

The cache directory used by arla is ${ARLA_CACHE}.
This directory should be on a local disk. You can change the location
of the cache directory by setting the ARLA_CACHE environment variable
(or by setting ARLA_CACHE in /etc/mk.conf) to the desired location prior
to building arla.

To complete the installation you'll have to configure arla.
Default configuration files are installed in ${PREFIX}/etc.

At a minimum, to configure an arla client, copy
${PREFIX}/etc/{CellServDB,SuidCells,ThisCell,arla.conf}.default to
${PREFIX}/etc/{CellServDB,SuidCells,ThisCell,arla.conf} and customize them.
Include an entry for xfs in your /etc/fstab
(see ${PREFIX}/share/examples/arla/fstab).
Also, append ${PREFIX}/share/examples/arla/services to /etc/services
and append ${PREFIX}/share/examples/arla/lkm.conf to /etc/lkm.conf.
You also have to enable loading of lkms in /etc/rc.conf (set lkm to YES).

Start scripts for arlad are provided in ${PREFIX}/etc/rc.d/arlad.sh (for
NetBSD prior to NetBSD-1.5) and ${PREFIX}/etc/rc.d/arlad (for NetBSD-1.5
and later).
