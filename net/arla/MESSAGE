Arla now has been installed on your system.

The cache directory used by arla is:

	${ARLA_CACHE}

This directory should be on a local disk.  You can change the location
of the cache directory by setting the ARLA_CACHE environment variable
(or by setting ARLA_CACHE in /etc/mk.conf) to the desired location prior
to building arla.

To complete the installation you'll have to configure arla.  Default
configuration files are installed in:

	${PREFIX}/share/examples/arla

At a minimum, to configure an arla client, copy:

	${PREFIX}/share/examples/CellServDB
	${PREFIX}/share/examples/SuidCells
	${PREFIX}/share/examples/ThisCell
	${PREFIX}/share/examples/arla.conf

to ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR} and customize them, include an entry for nnpfs in your
/etc/fstab (see ${PREFIX}/share/examples/arla/fstab), and append

	${PREFIX}/share/examples/arla/lkm.conf

to /etc/lkm.conf.  You also have to enable loading of lkms in /etc/rc.conf
(set lkm to YES).

NOTE: Please note that the name of the arla device changed from "xfs"
      to "nnpfs". If you're upgrading arla from an older version, you
      need to adjust /etc/fstab, /etc/lkm.conf, and /etc/rc.d/arlad.
