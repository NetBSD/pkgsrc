TTT: Tele Traffic Tapper

ttt is yet another descendant of tcpdump but it is capable of real-time,
graphical, and remote traffic-monitoring. ttt won't replace tcpdump, rather,
it helps you find out what to look into with tcpdump. ttt monitors the
network and automatically picks up the main contributors of the traffic
within the time window. The graphs are updated every second by default.

Features: 
	Automatic Ranking of Protocols and Hosts 
	Real-Time Monitoring 
	Remote Monitoring with IP-Multicast support 
	Accepts tcpdump output 
	IPv6 Aware (experimental) 
	Portable and easy to customize
