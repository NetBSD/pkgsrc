Before using the netsaint-base package for the first time, you need to
run the ${PREFIX}/etc/netsaint/netsaint-setup.sh script (as root) and
then set up the configuration files.  You can copy the sample
configuration files from ${PREFIX}/share/examples/netsaint to
${PREFIX}/etc/netsaint and then edit them accordingly.

The documentation is installed in ${PREFIX}/share/netsaint/docs.
  
Please note that without additional "plug-in" testing programs this
package will not do anything very useful.  It is therefore recommended
you install the 'netsaint-plugins' package as well, and perhaps the
other 'netsaint-plugin-*' packages too.

Important Information About the Future of NetSaint
--------------------------------------------------
Date: 01-16-2002

For various reasons, I am planning on no longer using "NetSaint" as the
title of this software package.  Version 0.0.7 will be will be the last
release of this software package under the "NetSaint" name.
