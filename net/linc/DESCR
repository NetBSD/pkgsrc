Linc is a library that eases the task of writing networked servers &
clients.  It takes care of connection initiation and maintainance,
and the details of various transports.  It is used by the new ORBit
to handle message transmission/receipt.

Currently supported transports:
        IPv4 (tested)
        UNIX domain sockets (tested)
        IPv6
        IrDA

The connections can optionally be encrypted using OpenSSL.
