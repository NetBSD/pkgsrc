TeamSpeak is a quality, scalable application which enables people
to speak with one another over the Internet. TeamSpeak consists of
both client and server software. The server acts as a host to
multiple client connections, capable of handling literally thousands
of simultaneous users. This results in an Internet based teleconferencing
solution that works in a variety of applications such as team mates
speaking with one another while playing their favorite online game,
small businesses cutting costs on long distance charges, or for
personal communication with friends and family.

This package contains the TeamSpeak server for Linux/i386
