ntop is a tool that shows the network usage, similar to what the
popular top Unix command does. ntop has been written in a portable
way in order to virtually run on every Unix platform.

ntop can be used in both interactive or web mode. In the first case,
ntop displays the network status on the user's terminmal whereas in
web mode a web browser (e.g. netscape) can attach to ntop (that acts
as a web server) and get a dump of thge network status. In the latter
case, ntop can be seen as a simple RMON-like agent with an embedded
web interface.
