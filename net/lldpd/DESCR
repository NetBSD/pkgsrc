LLDP allows you to know exactly on which port is a server
(and reciprocally).

LLDP is an industry standard protocol designed to supplant proprietary
Link-Layer protocols such as EDP or CDP. The goal of LLDP is to provide
an inter-vendor compatible mechanism to deliver Link-Layer notifications
to adjacent network devices.

lldpd is an ISC-licensed implementation of LLDP for various Unixes.
It also supports some proprietary protocols.
