httptunnel creates a bidirectional virtual data connection tunnelled in 
HTTP requests. The HTTP requests can be sent via an HTTP proxy if so desired. 

This can be useful for users behind restrictive firewalls. If WWW access 
is allowed through a HTTP proxy, it's possible to use httptunnel and, say, 
telnet or PPP to connect to a computer outside the firewall. 

httptunnel is written and maintained by Lars Brinkhoff. See the file AUTHORS 
in the tarball for more information about contributors to this package.
