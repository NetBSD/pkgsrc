libdnet provides a simplified, portable interface to several low-level
networking routines, including

    * network address manipulation
    * kernel arp(4) cache and route(4) table lookup and manipulation
    * network firewalling (IP filter, ipfw, ipchains, pf, ...)
    * network interface lookup and manipulation
    * raw IP packet and Ethernet frame transmission
