With synergy, all the computers on your desktop form a single
virtual screen. You use the mouse and keyboard of only one of the
computers while you use all of the monitors on all of the computers.
You tell synergy how many screens you have and their positions
relative to one another. Synergy then detects when the mouse moves
off the edge of a screen and jumps it instantly to the neighboring
screen. The keyboard works normally on each screen; input goes to
whichever screen has the cursor.
