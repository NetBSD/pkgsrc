  ORBit is a CORBA 2.2-compliant Object Request Broker (ORB) featuring
mature C and Perl bindings.  Bindings (in various degrees of completeness)
are also available for C++, Lisp, Pascal, Python, Ruby, and TCL; others
are in-progress.  It supports POA, DII, DSI, TypeCode, Any, IR and IIOP.

  Optional features including INS and threading are available.  ORBit is
engineered for the desktop workstation environment, with a focus on
performance, low resource usage, and security.

  The core ORB is written in C, and runs under Linux, UNIX (BSD, Solaris,
HP-UX, ...), and Windows.  ORBit is developed and released as open source
software under GPL/LGPL.
