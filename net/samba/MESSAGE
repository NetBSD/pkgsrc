                    *===* Security Notes *===*

The users' encrypted passwords stored in ${ETCDIR}/private/smbpasswd 
(default: /etc/samba/private/smbpasswd) *ARE PASSWORD EQUIVALENT*
from the viewpoint of SMB protocol.  Do not weaken the permission 
mode of this file (default: root.wheel and rw-------) without any
special reasons.  And please note that even if you pkg_delete this
port, pkg_delete will *NOT* remove the smbpasswd file because
pkg_delete can be used for upgrading this package.  If you won't use
this package anymore, I strongly recommend that you remove the
smbpasswd file manually.
