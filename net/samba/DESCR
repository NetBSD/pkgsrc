Samba provides file and print services for Microsoft Windows clients.
These services may be hosted off any TCP/IP-enabled platform.  The
Samba project includes not only an impressive feature set in file and
print serving capabilities, but has been extended to include client
functionality, utilities to ease migration to Samba, tools to aid
interoperability with Microsoft Windows, and administration tools.

This package provides samba3, which was declared obsolete in March,
2015. The current stable version of samba lives in net/samba4.
