Here is a summary of the steps needed to complete the netdisco setup.
Please look at the documentation in ${PREFIX}/doc/ for details.
- add the netdisco administrator(s) account(s) to the netdisco group
- cd to ${PREFIX}/netdisco/sql/ and run ./pg_init, ./pg_run and ./pg_all
  to create the netdisco database in postgresql.  This will prompt for a
  password which will then be used to access the netdisco database.
  Rememer this password as you will need it later.
- edit ${PREFIX}/netdisco/netdisco.conf to suit your needs. You have to
  set the database password you entered in the previous step here.
- Add a user to the netdisco system: ${PREFIX}/netdisco/netdisco -u joebob
  Give this user administration privileges, so that it will be able to
  create other users though the web interface.
- Import the OUI database:
  ${PREFIX}/netdisco/netdisco -o
- Add an appropriate crontab to user netdisco. ${EGDIR} contains an
  appropriate sample.
- Include netdisco to your apache config. ${EGDIR} contains 2 config
  fragments: netdisco_apache.conf and netdisco_apache_dir.conf which
  can be inclued in the httpd.conf to make netdisco available though
  http://your.host.name/netdisco/
  You will have to set the database password in netdisco_apache_dir.conf.
  Make sure you load mod_apreq.so in addition to mod_perl.so, and that
  you have "PerlModule Apache::compat"
- Make netdisco discover one of your devices:
  ${PREFIX}/netdisco/netdisco -d devicename
- Make netdisco discover your network topology, if supported by your
  devices: ${PREFIX}/netdisco/netdisco -r devicename
  If not supported by your devices, you'll have to fill in
  ${PREFIX}/netdisco/netdisco-topology.txt.
- start the admin daemon: /etc/rc.d/netdisco start
