This is a NetBSD decompressor for PPP compatible with the Stac LZS
scheme as described in rfc1974.  The algorithm is apparently covered
by patents held by Hifn in the USA and Europe though it was written 
independently with no help from Hifn or anybody associated with them,
and with no reference to the patents.  You might want to consider this
'example' code only if that makes you feel better.

This package patches the included pppd in NetBSD and thus, in order to
compile this, you will need to have the NetBSD source sets installed.
