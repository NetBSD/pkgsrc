In an Active Directory domain, a lot of interesting information can be
retrieved via LDAP by any authenticated user (or machine). This makes
LDAP an interesting protocol for gathering information in the recon
phase of a pentest of an internal network. A problem is that data from
LDAP often is not available in an easy to read format.

ldapdomaindump is a tool which aims to solve this problem, by
collecting and parsing information available via LDAP and outputting
it in a human readable HTML format, as well as machine readable json
and csv/tsv/greppable files.
