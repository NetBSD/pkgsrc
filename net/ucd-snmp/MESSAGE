You may want to install the x11/p5-Tk and net/p5-SNMP packages to
use the tkmib application!

You may also want to install the net/scotty package to do network
monitoring.

Finally, a note from the maintainer:

  I'm asking (begging) people to send me a postcard of your home
  city, area, or country.  I intend to arrange them into a logo,
  take a picture of them all, and use the picture on the ucd-snmp
  web page.  I've gotten a few already, but need a lot more to make
  the logo a decent size.  The first pass from the postcards people
  have sent me so far can be seen on the ucd-snmp web site, listed
  below.  If you wish to send a postcard, please send it to:
