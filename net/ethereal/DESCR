Ethereal is a free network protocol analyzer for Unix and Windows.
It allows you to examine data from a live network or from a capture file
on disk.  You can interactively browse the capture data, viewing summary
and detail information for each packet.  Ethereal has several powerful
features, including a rich display filter language and the ability to view
the reconstructed stream of a TCP session.
