This is Eric E. Fair's implementation of identd:

      A proper identification protocol (RFC 1413) implementation,
      providing all the utility, security, and authentication of
      all other implementations of this protocol, without all the
      expensive and pointless grovelling in /dev/kmem.

      Careful design and software engineering makes this software
      efficient, fast, compact, scalable, and completely maintenance
      free.

      Anyone who feels the need to use a daemon more complex than
      this one should go read section 6 of RFC 1413 very carefully,
      and think again.
