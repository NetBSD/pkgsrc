netatalk is an implementation of the AppleTalk Protocol Suite for
Unix systems. The current release contains support for EtherTalk
Phase I and II, DDP, RTMP, NBP, ZIP, AEP, ATP, PAP, ASP, and AFP.

DDP is in the kernel. atalkd implements RTMP, NBP, ZIP, and AEP.
It is the AppleTalk equivalent of Unix routed and ifconfig. There
is also a client-stub library for NBP. ATP and ASP are implemented
as libraries. papd allows Macs to spool to lpd or a pipe, and pap
allows Unix machines to print to AppleTalk connected printers. psf
is a PostScript printer filter for lpd, designed to use pap. psorder
is a PostScript reverser, called by psf to reverse pages printed
to face-up stacking printers. afpd provides Macs with an interface
to the Unix file system. Refer to the appropriate man pages for
operational information.

This version has been enhanced by Adrian Sun.
