The Twitter API keys (CK/CS) for mikutter has been suspended since
May 4th 2018, so currently mikutter cannot connect to Twitter APIs
and you cannot use mikutter as a Twitter client with the default settings.

To use Twitter via mikutter you also need to get your own Twitter CK/CS
and install the "twitter_api_keys" plugin with your CK/CS.

See @Akkiesoft's document "How to make mikutter work again" for details:
