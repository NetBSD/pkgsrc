Sharity-Light is derived from smbfs, but runs as a user level program, not
in the kernel. It is roughly the opposite of Samba since it's a client for
the Lanmanager protocol. Sharity-Light lets you mount drives exported by
Windows (f.Workgroups/95/NT), Lan Manager, OS/2 etc. on Unix machines. The
former name of this application was "rumba".
