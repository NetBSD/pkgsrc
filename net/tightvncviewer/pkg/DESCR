"VNC stands for Virtual Network Computing. It is, in essence, a remote
 display system which allows you to view a computing 'desktop'
 environment not only on the machine where it is running, but from
 anywhere on the Internet and from a wide variety of machine
 architectures."

Tight VNC is a modified version of VNC that offers some performance
improvements -- local cursor handling, better compression algorithms,
etc.

This package contains the viewer for remote X and Win32 VNC servers
