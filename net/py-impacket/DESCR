Impacket is a collection of Python classes for working with network
protocols. Impacket is mostly focused on providing low-level
programmatic access to the packets, however some protocols (for
instance NMB and SMB) are implemented in a higher level as a
foundation for other protocols. Packets can be constructed from
scratch, as well as parsed from raw data, and the object oriented
API makes it simple to work with deep hierarchies of protocols.

Impacket is most useful when used together with a packet capture
utility or package such as Pcapy, an object oriented Python extension
for capturing network packets.
