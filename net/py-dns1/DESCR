dnspython is a DNS toolkit for Python. It provides both high and low
level access to DNS. The high level classes perform queries for data
of a given name, type, and class, and return an answer set. The low
level classes allow direct manipulation of DNS zones, messages, names,
and records.

This is the python-2.x version of the module.
