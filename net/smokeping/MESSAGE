Smokeping is now installed.
The documentation can be found at ${PREFIX}/share/doc/smokeping/

A sample config file can be found in:
	${PREFIX}/share/examples/smokeping/config.dist

A copy has been installed as ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/config and you will
need to adjust it as needed.  You may also want to have a look at
basepage.html and smokemail in this directory.

Make sure that your web's server /cgi-bin/smokeping.cgi refers to
${PREFIX}/libexec/cgi-bin/smokeping.cgi, or copy the smokeping in your
web server's cgi space.
Also make sure that /cropper/ refers to ${PREFIX}/share/httpd/htdocs/cropper/

You will need to make smokeping accessible through your HTTP server.
If you are running Apache then you may add the following lines to httpd.conf:

	Include ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/smokeping.conf

to make smokeping accessible through:

	http://localhost/cgi-bin/smokeping.cgi

Please remember to grant write permissions to the following directory for
the user your web server runs as:

	${PREFIX}/share/smokeping/.simg
