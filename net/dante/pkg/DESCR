  Dante is a circuit-level firewall/proxy that can be used to provide
convenient and secure network connectivity to a wide range of hosts while
requiring only the server Dante runs on to have external network
connectivity.  Once installed, Dante can in most cases be made transparent
to the clients while offering detailed access control and logging facilities
to the server administrator. Developed by Inferno Nettverk A/S, Dante
usually comes installed as part of a bigger Inferno Nettverk firewall
system.

  The Dante version provided via FTP is under a BSD/CMU-type license and
comes with complete source code, for your convenience and verification
availability.
