dnspython is a DNS toolkit for Python. It supports almost all record
types. It can be used for queries, zone transfers, and dynamic
updates. It supports TSIG authenticated messages and EDNS0.

dnspython provides both high and low level access to DNS. The high
level classes perform queries for data of a given name, type, and
class, and return an answer set. The low level classes allow direct
manipulation of DNS zones, messages, names, and records.

dnspython is a utility to work with DNS, /etc/hosts is thus not
used. For simple forward DNS lookups, it's better to use
socket.gethostbyname().

dnspython originated at Nominum where it was developed to facilitate
the testing of DNS software.
