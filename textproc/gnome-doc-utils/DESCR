gnome-doc-utils is a collection of documentation utilities for the GNOME
project.  Notably, it contains utilities for building documentation and
all auxiliary files in your source tree, and it contains the DocBook XSLT
stylesheets that were once distributed with Yelp.

This package is deprecated upstream. Use yelp-tools instead.
