Libxslt is the XSLT C library developed for the Gnome project. XSLT itself is
an XML language to define transformation for XML. Libxslt is based on libxml2
the XML C library developed for the Gnome project. It also implements most of
the EXSLT set of extensions functions and some of Saxon's evaluate and
expressions extensions.
