The cElementTree module is a C implementation of the ElementTree API, optimized
for fast parsing and low memory use. On typical documents, cElementTree is 15-20
times faster than the Python version of ElementTree, and uses 2-5 times less
memory. On modern hardware, that means that documents in the 50-100 megabyte
range can be manipulated in memory, and that documents in the 0-1 megabyte range
load in zero time (0.0 seconds). This allows you to drastically simplify many
kinds of XML applications.

Deprecated since Python 3.3 as xml.etree.ElementTree will automatically
use a fast implementation whenever available.
