  Html2text reads HTML 3.2 documents from the input-urls, formats each
into a stream of ASCII characters and writes the result to standard
output (or into output-file, if the -o command line option is used).
It also accepts syntactically incorrect input and attempts to inter-
pret it "reasonably".

  Documents that are specified by a URL that begins with "http:" are
retrieved with the Hypertext Transfer Protocol. URLs that begin with
"file:" and URLs that do not contain a colon specify local files.

  Html2text was written by Arno Unkrig and is available under a
BSD-style licence.
