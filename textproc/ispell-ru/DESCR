This is a new Russian (KOI8-R) dictionaries for ispell.

The word list is based on the early one collected by Neal Dalton.
After removing illegal words and adding many new rules and words,
the dictionaries contain now over 116,200 basic words and produce
over 1,116,000 related words (compared to 52,000 words in Neal's
version and 952,000 words in the dictionary by K. Knizhnik).

Also, this package seems to be the only one that supports the right
spelling of words with the Russian letter 'yo' (other dictionaries
simply replace the letter 'yo' by 'ye').
