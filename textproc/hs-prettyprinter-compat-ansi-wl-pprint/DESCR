This package defines a compatibility layer between the old ansi-wl-pprint
package, and the new prettyprinter/prettyprinter-ansi-terminal ones.

This allows easily transitioning dependent packages from the old to the new
package, by simply replacing ansi-wl-pprint with
prettyprinter-ansi-terminal in the .cabal file. For adapting third party
plugins that output ansi-wl-pprint data, use the proper converter from the
prettyprinter-convert-ansi-wl-pprint module.

Note that this package is only for transitional purposes, and therefore
deprecated and wholly undocumented. For new development, use the current
version of prettyprinter, and the ANSI terminal backend provided in
prettyprinter-ansi-terminal.
