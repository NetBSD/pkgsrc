Kirill Siminov's libyaml is arguably the best YAML implementation.
The C library is written precisely to the YAML 1.1 specification.
It was originally bound to Python and was later bound to Ruby.

This module is a Perl XS binding to libyaml which will (eventually)
offer Perl the best YAML support to date.

This module exports the functions Dump and Load. These functions are
intended to work exactly like YAML.pm's corresponding functions.
