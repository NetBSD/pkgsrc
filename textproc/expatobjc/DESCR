Expatobjc is a small library that allows you to use James Clark's
Expat XML parser library more easily with Objective C.  It provides an
object-oriented interface to the library which is similar to SAX2.

To use it, make a subclass of the XMLParser object that will override
any or all of the following methods based on what parts of the XML
parser document you want to read and analyze:

startElement - for element start tags 
endElement - for element end tags
characters - for PCDATA stuff
processingInstruction - for XML processing instructions
comment - for XML comments
startCdata - for the start of a CDATA section
endCdata - for the end of a CDATA section
externalEntity - for an external entity declaration
unparsedEntityDecl - for an unparsed entity declaration
startPrefixMapping - for the start of a namespace prefix declaration
endPrefixMapping - for the end of a namespace prefix declaration
defaultHandler - for any text that is not parsed above
