word2vec is an implementation of the Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW)
and the Skip-gram model (SG), as well as several demo scripts.  Given
a text corpus, the word2vec tool learns a vector for every word in the
vocabulary using the Continuous Bag-of-Words or the Skip-Gram neural
network architectures.
