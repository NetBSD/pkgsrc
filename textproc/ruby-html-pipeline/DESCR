HTML::Pipeline

HTML processing filters and utilities.  This module includes a small
framework for defining DOM based content filters and applying them to user
provided content.

This project was started at GitHub.  While GitHub still uses a similar
design and pattern for rendering content, this gem should be considered
standalone and independent from GitHub.
