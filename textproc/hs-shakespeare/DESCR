Shakespeare is a family of type-safe, efficient template languages.
Shakespeare templates are expanded at compile-time, ensuring that all
interpolated variables are in scope.  Variables are interpolated
according to their type through a typeclass.

Shakespeare templates can be used inline with a quasi-quoter or in an
external file.
