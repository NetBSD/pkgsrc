This is a native Ruby package for reading and writing INI files.


Description
-----------

Although made popular by Windows, INI files can be used on any system thanks
to their flexibility. They allow a program to store configuration data, which
can then be easily parsed and changed. Two notable systems that use the INI
format are Samba and Trac.

More information about INI files can be found on the
[Wikipedia Page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file).
