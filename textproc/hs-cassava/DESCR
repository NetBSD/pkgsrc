format commonly used for exchanging tabular data.

cassava's API includes support for

- Index-based record-conversion
- Name-based record-conversion
- Typeclass directed conversion of fields and records
- Built-in field-conversion instances for standard types
- Customizable record-conversion instance derivation via GHC generics
- Low-level bytestring builders (see "Data.Csv.Builder")
- Incremental decoding and encoding API (see "Data.Csv.Incremental")
- Streaming API for constant-space decoding (see "Data.Csv.Streaming")
