Sphinx is a tool that makes it easy to create intelligent and beautiful
documentation for Python projects (or other documents consisting of multiple
reStructuredText sources), written by Georg Brandl. It was originally
created to translate the new Python documentation, but has now been cleaned
up in the hope that it will be useful to many other projects.

Sphinx uses reStructuredText as its markup language, and many of its
strengths come from the power and straightforwardness of reStructuredText
and its parsing and translating suite, the Docutils.

Although it is still under constant development, the following features are
already present, work fine and can be seen "in action" in the Python docs:
* Output formats: HTML (including Windows HTML Help), plain text and LaTeX,
  for printable PDF versions
* Extensive cross-references: semantic markup and automatic links for
  functions, classes, glossary terms and similar pieces of information
* Hierarchical structure: easy definition of a document tree, with automatic
  links to siblings, parents and children
* Automatic indices: general index as well as a module index
* Code handling: automatic highlighting using the Pygments highlighter
* Various extensions are available, e.g. for automatic testing of snippets
  and inclusion of appropriately formatted docstrings.
