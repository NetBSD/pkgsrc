Dblatex started as a DB2LaTeX clone, but since then many things
have changed and new features have been added or (hopefully)
improved. Now, the portion of shared code is small if any, and the
dblatex purpose is different from DB2LaTeX on these points:

* The project is end-user oriented, that is, it tries to hide as
much as possible the latex compiling stuff by providing a single
clean script to produce directly DVI, PostScript and PDF output.

* The actual output rendering is done not only by the XSL stylesheets
transformation, but also by a dedicated LaTeX package. The goal is
to allow a deep LaTeX customisation without changing the XSL
stylesheets.

* Post-processing is done by Python, to make publication faster,
convert the images if needed, and do the whole compilation.
