Skylighting is a syntax highlighting library. It derives its
tokenizers from XML syntax definitions used by KDE's
KSyntaxHighlighting framework, so any syntax supported by that
framework can be added. An optional command-line program is
provided. Skylighting is intended to be the successor to
highlighting-kate. This package provides the core highlighting
functionality under a permissive license.
