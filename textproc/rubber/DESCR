Rubber is a building system for LaTeX documents.

It is based on a routine that runs just as many compilations as necessary.  The
module system provides a great flexibility that virtually allows support for
any package with no user intervention, as well as pre- and post-processing of
the document.  The standard modules currently provide support for bibtex,
dvips, dvipdfm, pdftex, makeindex.  A good number of standard packages are
supported, including graphics/graphicx (with automatic conversion between
various formats and Metapost compilation).
