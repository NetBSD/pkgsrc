LuaExpat is a XML parser based on the Expat XML parser.
It allows Lua programs to:

- Process a XML document incrementally, thus being able to handle
  huge documents without memory penalties;

- Register handler functions which are called by the parser during
  the processing of the document, handling the document elements or text.
