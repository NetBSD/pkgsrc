libfyaml is a fancy 1.2 YAML and JSON parser/writer.

Fully feature complete YAML parser and emitter, supporting the latest YAML spec
and passing the full YAML testsuite.

It is designed to be very efficient, avoiding copies of data, and has no
artificial limits like the 1024 character limit for implicit keys.

libfyaml is using https://github.com/yaml/yaml-test-suite as a core part of its
testsuite.
