A new XML Writer was needed to match the SAX2 effort because quite
naturally no existing writer understood SAX2. My first intention
had been to start patching XML::Handler::YAWriter as it had previously
been my favourite writer in the SAX1 world.

However the more I patched it the more I realised that what I
thought was going to be a simple patch (mostly adding a few event
handlers and changing the attribute syntax) was turning out to be
a rewrite due to various ideas I'd been collecting along the way.
Besides, I couldn't find a way to elegantly make it work with SAX2
without breaking the SAX1 compatibility which people are probably
still using. There are of course ways to do that, but most require
user interaction which is something I wanted to avoid.

So in the end there was a new writer. I think it's in fact better
this way as it helps keep SAX1 and SAX2 separated.
