Running ${PKGNAME} binaries
===========================

Most of the ${PKGNAME} binaries have the same name as their respective
counterpart in groff.  To avoid conflicts the ${PKGNAME} binaries have
been installed to ${PREFIX}/heirloom-doctools/bin.  To use these tools
you should add this directory to your PATH variable (for e.g. ksh):

export PATH=${PREFIX}/heirloom-doctools/bin:$PATH

Reading ${PKGNAME} manpages
===========================

The manpages are installed to ${PREFIX}/heirloom-doctools/man.  Since
manpages with the same name are use by groff adding this path to
man.conf(5) may not make sense.  Instead set (ksh example)

export MANPATH=${PREFIX}/heirloom-doctools/man:

in the terminal where you want to read the manuals.
