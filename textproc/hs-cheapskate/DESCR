This is an experimental Markdown processor in pure Haskell. It aims to
process Markdown efficiently and in the most forgiving possible
way. It is designed to deal with any input, including garbage, with
linear performance. Output is sanitized by default for protection
against XSS attacks.

Several markdown extensions are implemented, including fenced code
blocks, significant list start numbers, and autolinked URLs.
