The package provides a simple LaTeX interface for the
processing of files with comma separated values (CSV); it
relies on the key value syntax supported by pgfkeys to simplify
usage. Filtering and table generation is especially supported;
however, this lightweight tool offers no support for data
sorting or data base storage.
