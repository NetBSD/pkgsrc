The stem function takes a scalar as a parameter and stems the word
according to Martin Porters Norwegian stemming algorithm, which can be
found at the Snowball website: http://snowball.tartarus.org/.

It also supports caching if the use_cache option is passed when
constructing a new L:S:S:N object.
