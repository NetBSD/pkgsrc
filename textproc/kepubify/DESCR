Convert EPUBs to Kobo EPUBs.

Kepubify is the fastest tool for converting EPUBs to Kobo's enhanced
KEPUB format for use on Kobo eReaders.

It works with malformed e-books, doesn't modify the book's layout more
than absolutely necessary, doesn't depend on any external software, and
works from the command-line.
