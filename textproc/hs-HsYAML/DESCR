HsYAML is a YAML 1.2 processor, i.e. a library for parsing and
serializing YAML documents.

Features of HsYAML include:
* Pure Haskell implementation with small dependency footprint and
  emphasis on strict compliance with the YAML 1.2 specification.
* Direct decoding to native Haskell types via (aeson-inspired)
  typeclass-based API (see Data.YAML).
* Allows round-tripping while preserving ordering, anchors, and
  comments at Event-level.
* Support for constructing custom YAML node graph representation
  (including support for cyclic YAML data structures).
* Support for the standard (untyped) Failsafe, (strict) JSON, and
  (flexible) Core "schemas" providing implicit typing rules as defined
  in the YAML 1.2 specification (including support for user-defined
  custom schemas; see Data.YAML.Schema).
* Support for emitting YAML using Failsafe, (strict) JSON, and
  (flexible) Core "schemas" (including support for user-defined custom
  encoding schemas; see Data.YAML.Schema).
* Event-based API resembling LibYAML's Event-based API (see
  Data.YAML.Event).
* Low-level API access to lexical token-based scanner (see
  Data.YAML.Token).
