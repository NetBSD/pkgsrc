This package provides parsing and rendering functions for XML. It is
based on the datatypes found in the xml-types package. This package is
broken up into the following modules:

* Text.XML: DOM-based parsing and rendering. This is the most commonly
  used module.

* Text.XML.Cursor: A wrapper around Text.XML which allows
  bidirectional traversing of the DOM, similar to XPath. (Note:
  Text.XML.Cursor.Generic is the same concept, but will work with any
  node representation.)

* Text.XML.Unresolved: A slight modification to Text.XML which does
  not require all entities to be resolved at parsing. The datatypes
  are slightly more complicated here, and therefore this module is
  only recommended when you need to deal directly with raw entities.

* Text.XML.Stream.Parse: Streaming parser, including some streaming
  parser combinators.

* Text.XML.Stream.Render: Streaming renderer.
