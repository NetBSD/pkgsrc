Skylighting is a syntax highlighting library with support for over one
hundred languages. It derives its tokenizers from XML syntax
definitions used by KDE's KSyntaxHighlighting framework, so any syntax
supported by that framework can be added. An optional command-line
program is provided. Skylighting is intended to be the successor to
highlighting-kate. This package provides generated syntax modules
based on the KDE XML definitions provided by the skylighting-core
package. As a result this package is licensed under the GPL.
