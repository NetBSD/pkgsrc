Xerces (named after the Xerces Blue butterfly) provides world-class XML
parsing and generation. Fully-validating parsers are available for both
Java and C++, implementing the W3C XML and DOM (Level 1 and 2) standards,
as well as the defacto SAX (version 2) standard. The parsers are highly
modular and configurable.  Initial support for XML Schema (draft W3C
standard) is also provided. 

This package provides the Java version of Xerces.
