hck is a shortening of hack, a rougher form of cut.

A close to drop in replacement for cut that can use a regex delimiter instead
of a fixed string. Additionally this tool allows for specification of the order
of the output columns using the same column selection syntax as cut.

No single feature of hck on its own makes it stand out over awk, cut, xsv or
other such tools. Where hck excels is making common things easy, such as
reordering output fields, or splitting records on a weird delimiter. It is
meant to be simple and easy to use while exploring datasets. Think of this as
filling a gap between cut and awk.
