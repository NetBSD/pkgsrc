demjson3 is a Python language module for encoding, decoding, and
syntax-checking JSON data. It works under Python 3.

It comes with a jsonlint script which can be used to validate your JSON
documents for strict conformance to the JSON specification, and to detect
potential data portability issues. It can also reformat or pretty-print JSON
documents; either by re-indenting or removing unnecessary whitespace.
