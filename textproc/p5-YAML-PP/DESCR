YAML::PP is a modern, modular YAML processor. It aims to support YAML
1.2 and YAML 1.1.

The YAML::PP frontend will currently load all documents, and return only
the last if called with scalar context.

The YAML backend is implemented in a modular way that allows to add
custom handling of YAML tags, perl objects and data types.
