Kubo was the first IPFS implementation and is the most widely used
one today. It implements the Interplanetary Filesystem - the Web3
standard for content-addressing, interoperable with HTTP. It is
powered by IPLD's data models and libp2p for network communication.
Kubo is written in Go.

Featureset

* Runs an IPFS-Node as a network service
* Command Line Interface to IPFS-Nodes
* Local Web2-to-Web3 HTTP Gateway functionality
* HTTP RPC API (/api/v0) to access and control the daemon
* IPFS's internal Webgui can be used to manage the Kubo nodes

IPFS is a global, versioned, peer-to-peer filesystem. It combines
good ideas from previous systems such as Git, BitTorrent, Kademlia,
SFS, and the Web. It is like a single BitTorrent swarm, exchanging
git objects. IPFS provides an interface as simple as the HTTP web,
but with permanence built-in. You can also mount the world at /ipfs.
