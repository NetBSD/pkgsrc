IPFS is a global, versioned, peer-to-peer filesystem. It combines
good ideas from previous systems such as Git, BitTorrent, Kademlia,
SFS, and the Web. It is like a single BitTorrent swarm, exchanging
git objects. IPFS provides an interface as simple as the HTTP web,
but with permanence built-in. You can also mount the world at /ipfs.
