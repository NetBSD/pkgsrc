The FUSE-based union file system allows several directories to be
stacked under one mountpoint - this will produce the effect of
having a number of directories merged under one mountpoint.

This utility is implemented at the user level - to mount a series
of roots, simply use:

	unionfs /dir1:/dir2:/dir3 /mnt
