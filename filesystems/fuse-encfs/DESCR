EncFS provides an encrypted filesystem in user-space. It runs without any
special permissions and uses the FUSE library.

As with most encrypted filesystems, Encfs is meant to provide security
against off-line attacks; ie your notebook or backups fall into the wrong
hands, etc.

This project is not maintained upstream.
