The program is a viewer and editor for: 
  -GDSII files, KEY files (own made extended GDSII in ascii format) and
   DAVID MANN files (flash format for mask plotting) 

Features: 
 -It allows to draw primitives on a chosen layer, and to manipulate them.
 -stack oriented tools allows zooming while drawing new primitives and
  editing them. This also makes it possible to draw extremely accurate. 
 -primitives on the layers or/can be transparent  colors and fill patterns
  can be set on a layer basis 
 -drawing order of layers can be changed 
 -a hiearchy of pictures, named structures, can be handled and manipulated
 -saving as a bitmap and other formats. 
 -measuring distances 
 -adding user defined properties to primitives 


 -boolean OR AND EXOR A-B B-A 
 -positive and negative process offset 
 -circle recognition in polygon and polyline data. 
 -move copy delete etc. 
 -transformations (scaling , rotation , moving) 
 -flatten the hiearchy of the drawing 
 -drivers for CNC (laser and milling machinery)
