SOLVESPACE is a parametric 3d CAD program. Applications include:

  modeling 3d parts - draw with extrudes, revolves, and Boolean
      (union / difference) operations

  modeling 2d parts - draw the part as a single section, and export
      DXF, PDF, SVG; use 3d assembly to verify fit

  3d-printed parts - export the STL or other triangle mesh expected
      by most 3d printers

  preparing CAM data - export 2d vector art for a waterjet machine
      or laser cutter; or generate STEP or STL, for import into
      third-party CAM software for machining

  mechanism design - use the constraint solver to simulate planar
      or spatial linkages, with pin, ball, or slide joints

  plane and solid geometry - replace hand-solved trigonometry and
      spreadsheets with a live dimensioned drawing
