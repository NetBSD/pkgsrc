${PCB_CONFDIR}, $HOME/.pcb and the current working directory are
all included in the search path for m4 files.  In addition, the
files "site-config.inc" (which would normally live in ${PCB_CONFDIR}),
"user-config.inc" (which would normally live $HOME/.pcb) and
"proj-config.inc" (in the working directory) are included if they
exist.  This provides a mechanism for per-site, per-user,
and per-project libraries.
