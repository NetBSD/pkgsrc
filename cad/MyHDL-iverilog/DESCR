MyHDL is a Python package for using Python as a hardware
description language. Popular hardware description languages, like
Verilog and VHDL, are compiled languages. MyHDL with Python
can be viewed as a "scripting language" counterpart of such
languages. However, Python is more accurately described as a very
high level language (VHLL). MyHDL users have access to the
amazing power and elegance of Python for their modeling work.

This package is Icarus Verilog cosimulation support for py-MyHDL.
