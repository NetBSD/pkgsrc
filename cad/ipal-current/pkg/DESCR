Icarus PAL is a set of libraries and utilities for manipulating PAL
designs.  The design information is conveyed in the industry standard
JEDEC file format.

Icarus PAL accepts parts descriptions that detail the device
structure, capabilities and pinouts so that software can be written to
work relatively independent of the part type. These parts descriptions
also describe how the fuses of a device are arranged, so that
synthesis tools can generate fuse maps to get the desired
functionality and pinout. See as a commented example the description
in the pa/pal22v10.pa description.

The ipaledit program takes as input a .JED file and displays the PAL
design. It shows the sum-of-products as a fuse matrix, and shows the
macrocell configurations in convenient form.

The ipalrev program takes as input a .JED file and reverse compiles
it, producing a Verilog program that logically describes the
design. This use useful for moving old designs to new tools.

Please note that this package is a development snapshot and while it contains
the latest and greatest features, it may be buggy as well.  When 
available there will be a seperate ipal package which will be made of
the stable releases.
