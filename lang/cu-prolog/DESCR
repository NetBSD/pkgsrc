cu-Prolog is an experimental constraint logic programming language.
Unlike most conventional CLP systems, cu-Prolog allows user-defined
predicates as constraints and is suitable for implementing a natural
language processing system based on the unification-based grammar.
As an application of cu-Prolog, we developed a JPSG (Japanese Phrase
Structure Grammar) parser with the JPSG Working Group (the chairman is
Prof. GUNJI, Takao of Osaka University) at ICOT.

cu-Prolog is also the complete implementation of the constraint
unification and its name (cu) comes from the technique.
