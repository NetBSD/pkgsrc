# If purs is to be linked dynamically, it will depend on more than 180
# shared objects and the dynamic linker will spend several seconds to
# resolve symbols on startup. This is unacceptable because purs tends to be
# launched very frequently by build systems. This wastes storage, but time
# is more expensive than disks.
HASKELL_ENABLE_SHARED_LIBRARY=	no

# It makes no sense to build the profiling library because this package
# isn't meant to be used as a library.
HASKELL_ENABLE_LIBRARY_PROFILING=	no

# These constraints can only be solved with GHC 9.2.3 which we haven't
# packaged yet.
