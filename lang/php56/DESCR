PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language. It is modular, with
some object-oriented features. Much of its syntax is borrowed from
C, Java and Perl with a couple of unique PHP-specific features
thrown in.  The language is designed to allow web developers to
write dynamically generated pages quickly.

This package provides PHP version 5.6.x.

NOTE: This version reached End of Life on December 31 2018. Updating to
PHP 7.3.x, 7.4.x, or 8.0.x is strongly recommended.
