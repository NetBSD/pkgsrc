Chibi-Scheme is a very small library intended for use as an extension
and scripting language in C programs.  In addition to support for
lightweight VM-based threads, each VM itself runs in an isolated heap
allowing multiple VMs to run simultaneously in different OS threads.

The default repl language contains all bindings from R7RS small,
available explicitly as the (scheme small) library.

Support for additional languages such as JavaScript, Go, Lua and Bash
are planned for future releases.  Scheme is chosen as a substrate
because its first class continuations and guaranteed tail-call
optimization makes implementing other languages easy.
