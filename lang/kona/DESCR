Kona is the open-source implementation of the k3 programming language.
k is a synthesis of APL and LISP. Although many of the capabilities
come from APL, the fundamental data construct is quite different.
In APL the construct is a multi-dimensional matrix-like array, where
the dimension of the array can range from 0 to some maximum (often 9).
In k, like LISP, the fundamental data construct is a list. Also, like
LISP, the k language is ASCII-based, so you don't need a special keyboard.

For many people, k was the preferred APL dialect.
When it was available, it tended to be popular with investment bankers,
the performance obsessed, and analysts dealing with lots of data.
It is a demanding language.
