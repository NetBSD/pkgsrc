PHP is a widely-used open source general-purpose scripting language
that is especially suited for web development and can be embedded
into HTML.  It is modular, and object-oriented.  Much of its syntax
is borrowed from C, Java and Perl with a couple of unique PHP-specific
features thrown in.  The language is designed to allow web developers
to write dynamically generated pages quickly.

PHP 7.4 comes with numerous improvements and new features such as

* Typed Properties
* Arrow Functions
* Limited Return Type Covariance and Argument Type Contravariance
* Unpacking Inside Arrays
* Numeric Literal Separator
* Weak References
* Allow Exceptions from __toString()
* Opcache Preloading
* Several Deprecations
* Extensions Removed from the Core
