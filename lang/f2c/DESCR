f2c is a Fortran 77 to C compiler (translates fortran to C).

A script, f2c-f77, is included  which works with f2c and the C compiler
to emulate a f77 fortran compiler.

f2c is distributed by netlib.

There do not appear to be released versions of f2c with an assigned
version number.  When updates are made, the "changes" file is updated,
but there is no associated version number.  I don't have any suggestions
for keeping track of the version except to consult the "changes" file 
which will be installed as ${PREFIX}/share/doc/f2c/changes for reference.
