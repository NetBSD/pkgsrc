newLISP is a Lisp-like, general-purpose scripting language. It is
especially well-suited for applications in AI, web search, natural
language processing, and machine learning. Because of its small
resource requirements, newLISP is also excellent for embedded
systems applications. Most of the functions you will ever need are
already built in. This includes networking functions, support for
distributed and parallel processing, and Bayesian statistics.
