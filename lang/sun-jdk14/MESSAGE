In order to invoke the JVM, the data segment size set by ýour shells
'ulimit' builtin must be at least 131204 -- please refer to your
shells manual page for details.

You may want to read ${JDK_HOME}/README for details about
running this jdk. In a nutshell you may want to set the following in
your shell environment:

	CLASSPATH to ${JDK_HOME}/src.zip:.
        JAVA_HOME to ${JDK_HOME}
	${PATH} to include ${JDK_HOME}/bin
