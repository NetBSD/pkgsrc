GUILE, GNU's Ubiquitous Intelligent Language for Extension, is a library
that implements the Scheme language plus various convenient facilities.
It's designed so that you can link it into an application or utility to
make it extensible. Our plan is to link this library into all GNU programs
that call for extensibility.

This is the previous stable version of guile, but also the most recent
version available in pkgsrc.
