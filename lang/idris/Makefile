# When -O2 is in effect, GHC 8.8.1 uses whopping 1 TiB of virtual
# memory (what?) to compile src/Idris/IBC.hs for some unknown reason,
# possibly related to https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/5642
# or https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/13535
HASKELL_OPTIMIZATION_LEVEL=	1

# Parallelization is unsafe because of the high memory consumption
# even with -O1. Setting it to -O0 may seem desirable, but that makes
# the resulting compiler way too slow.
MAKE_JOBS_SAFE=	NO

# bin/idris cannot survive PaX MPROTECT because of GHC rts not being
# safe. We can hopefully get rid of this in the near future. See also
# ../../lang/ghc88/Makefile
