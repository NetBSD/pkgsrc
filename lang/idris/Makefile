# When -O2 is in effect, GHC uses whopping 4 GiB of memory (what?) to

# If idris is to be linked dynamically, it will depend on more than 110
# shared objects and the dynamic linker will spend nearly a second to
# resolve symbols on startup. This is unacceptable because idris tends to
# be launched very frequently by build systems. This wastes storage, but
# time is more expensive than disks.

# It makes no sense to build the profiling library because this package
# isn't meant to be used as a library.

# idris is built with optparse-applicative, and can generate shell
# completion scripts automatically.
