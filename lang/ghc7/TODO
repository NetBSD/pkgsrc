wip/ghc TODO
============

* Modify configure.ac and rules/build-package-data.mk to allow
  ``--with-curses-{includes,libraries}`` to be passed to the top-level
  ``configure``, and send a patch to the upstream.
* Add the following ``./configure`` flags to eliminate
  ``patch-Makefile`` and ``patch-ghc.mk``:

  * ``--with-dist-archiver={bzip2,xz} [default=bzip2]``
  * ``BZIP2FLAGS``
  * ``XZFLAGS``

* Let ``./configure`` check for broken binutils and provide a better
  fix for ``patch-rts_StgCRun.c``.
* Build more bootstrapping compilers to support more platforms.


How to build a bootstrapping compiler
-------------------------------------

You need a working compiler to build one. If you think there are no
bindists for your platform, you may need to cross-build a compiler
yourself: `Cross-compiling GHC
<http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/Building/CrossCompiling>`_

Assuming you have a working ghc in your PATH, just run ``bmake patch
&& bmake bootstrap`` and see if you are lucky enough.
