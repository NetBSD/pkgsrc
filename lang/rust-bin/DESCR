Rust is a systems programming language focused on three goals: safety,
speed, and concurrency.  It maintains these goals without having a
garbage collector, making it a useful language for a number of use cases
other languages aren't good at: embedding in other languages, programs
with specific space and time requirements, and writing low-level code,
like device drivers and operating systems.

It improves on current languages targeting this space by having a number
of compile-time safety checks that produce no runtime overhead, while
eliminating all data races.  Rust also aims to achieve "zero-cost
abstractions" even though some of these abstractions feel like those of
a high-level language.  Even then, Rust still allows precise control
like a low-level language would.

This package installs a released binary.
