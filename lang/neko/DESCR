Neko is a high-level dynamically typed programming language. It can be used
as an embedded scripting language. It has been designed to provide a common
runtime for several different languages. Learning and using Neko is very
easy. You can easily extend the language with C libraries. You can also
write generators from your own language to Neko and then use the Neko
Runtime to compile, run, and access existing libraries.
