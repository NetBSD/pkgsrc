# Tries to build "bin/nekoc.n, bin/nekoml.n" multiple times at once
# and then chokes because nekoc.n won't load. Examination shows that
# the makefiles spewed from cmake try to build this element from four
# different subdirs at once, which is obviously unsafe, and arguing
# with cmake about this sort of thing is a waste of breath.
