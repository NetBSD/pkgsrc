The GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) includes front ends for C, C++, Objective-C,
Fortran, and Go, as well as libraries for these languages (libstdc++,
libgfortran, ...).

This packages provides GCC support libraries in a specific location and allows
packages to depend on just the libraries rather than having to pull in the full
GCC package.
