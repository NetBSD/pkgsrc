Suppress linker warnings about compatibility syscall wrappers by using
"capi" instead of "ccall". In Haskell FFI, "ccall" is actually an
interface to C ABI rather than C API. That is, GHC generates direct
references to the symbol even if it's actually defined as a cpp macro
or something like that, because GHC knows nothing about those macros
in foreign headers. Hence the following warnings:

  .../libHStime-1.4.0.1.a(CTimeval.o): In function `s1Kp_info':
  (.text+0x2f): warning: warning: reference to compatibility
  gettimeofday(); include <sys/time.h> to generate correct reference

In other words, you can safely use "ccall" only when you are sure the
symbol you want to import is actually a symbol in the ABI sense, which
is not always the case for the POSIX API.
