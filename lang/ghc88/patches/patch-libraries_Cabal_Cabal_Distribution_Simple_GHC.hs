$NetBSD: patch-libraries_Cabal_Cabal_Distribution_Simple_GHC.hs,v 1.1 2020/01/17 07:10:57 pho Exp $

Enable Cabal's rpath overriding functionality on all the platforms
known to use ELF.

When a Cabal package which defins both a library and an executable is
to be built, GHC by default embeds an rpath to the *build* directory
into the executable. This may sound like a bug in GHC but is actually
not, because GHC doesn't know the fact that the said library is going
to be installed elsewhere. To overcome this issue, Cabal has a
functionality to disable the default rpath handling of GHC and
construct the correct set of rpaths... but only on certain platforms
for some reason.
