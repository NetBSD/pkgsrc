GUILE, GNU's Ubiquitous Intelligent Language for Extension, is a library
that implements the Scheme language plus various convenient facilities.
It's designed so that you can link it into an application or utility to
make it extensible. Our plan is to link this library into all GNU programs
that call for extensibility.

This is guile 2.0, which became old in 2017.  It is installed into
PREFIX proper, but this should not be expected to continue.
