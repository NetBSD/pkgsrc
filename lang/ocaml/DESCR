Objective Caml is the latest implementation of the Caml dialect of ML. The main
novelties compared with its ancestor, Caml Light, are: 

     * Full support for objects and classes -- here combined for the first time
	with ML-style type reconstruction. 
     * A powerful module calculus in the style of Standard ML (but retaining
	separate compilation). 
     * A high-performance native code compiler (in addition to a Caml
	Light-style bytecode compiler).
