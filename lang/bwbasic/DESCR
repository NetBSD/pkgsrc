The Bywater BASIC Interpreter (bwBASIC) implements a large superset
of the ANSI Standard for Minimal BASIC (X3.60-1978) and a significant
subset of the ANSI Standard for Full BASIC (X3.113-1987) in C. It also
offers shell programming facilities as an extension of BASIC. bwBASIC
seeks to be as portable as possible.
