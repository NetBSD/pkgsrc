+/* Added by refling@comet.lbl.gov to compensate for the fact that the usec
+   value can go backwards within the same sec on NetBSD.  Problem has been
+   noted on sparc and i386.  It really only appears in the test routine
+   where times are differenced, causing negative numbers to be generated.
+   This WILL cause the build to fail consistently on my sparc LX, but not
+   on the i386, even though the problem can be demonstrated there.  See
+   NetBSD PR bin/10201.
+
+   The simple solution here is to have a persistent variable, and if the
+   usec value returned from getrusage() is LESS than the previous one
+   (stored in the persistent variable), use the previous one.  This is
+   only when the second counter is the same between the previous and
+   current usec.  This will make time stand still, but at least it
+   won't go backwards!
+
+   This could also be added to the definition of the NetBSD getrusage()
+   function to prevent it from returning bogus values in the first place,
+   if the real cause of the problem can't be tracked down.
+
+   Note that the patch to snobol4 (in this file) will not need to be
+   changed even if/when getrusage() is ultimately fixed.  The only expense
+   is a few extra numerical comparisons.  Typically, one doesn't take time
+   measurements too often.                                             */
