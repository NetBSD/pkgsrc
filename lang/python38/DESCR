Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented
programming language that combines remarkable power with
very clear syntax. For an introduction to programming in
Python you are referred to the Python Tutorial. The
Python Library Reference documents built-in and standard
types, constants, functions and modules. Finally, the
Python Reference Manual describes the syntax and semantics
of the core language in (perhaps too) much detail.

Python's basic power can be extended with your own modules
written in C or C++. On most systems such modules may be
dynamically loaded. Python is also adaptable as an exten-
sion language for existing applications. See the internal
documentation for hints.

This package provides Python version 3.8.x.
