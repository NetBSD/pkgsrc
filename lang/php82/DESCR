PHP is a widely-used open source general-purpose scripting language
that is especially suited for web development and can be embedded
into HTML.  It is modular, and object-oriented.  Much of its syntax
is borrowed from C, Java and Perl with a couple of unique PHP-specific
features thrown in.  The language is designed to allow web developers
to write dynamically generated pages quickly.

PHP 8.2 comes with numerous improvements and new features such as

* Readonly classes
* Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) Types
* New stand-alone types: null, false, and true
* New "Random" extension
* Constants in traits
* Deprecate dynamic properties
* And much much more...
