# If bin/dhall is to be linked dynamically, it will depend on more than 140
# shared objects and the dynamic linker will spend more than a second to
# resolve symbols on startup. This is unacceptable because dhall tends to
# be launched very frequently by editors or IDEs. This wastes storage, but
# time is more expensive than disks.
HASKELL_ENABLE_DYNAMIC_EXECUTABLE=	no
# However, since dhall can also be used as a library, we still want to
# build the shared library so that downstream packages can use it.

# This package installs an executable that can generate shell completion
# scripts automatically.
