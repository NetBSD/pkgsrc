MoonScript is a dynamic scripting language that compiles into Lua. It gives
you the power of one of the fastest scripting languages combined with a rich
set of features.

MoonScript can either be compiled into Lua and run at a later time, or it
can be dynamically compiled and run using the moonloader. It's as simple as
require "moonscript" in order to have Lua understand how to load and run
any MoonScript file.

Because it compiles right into Lua code, it is completely compatible with
alternative Lua implementations like LuaJIT, and it is also compatible with
all existing Lua code and libraries.

The command line tools also let you run MoonScript directly from the command
line, like any first-class scripting language.
